Nevertheless, most of toilet repairs are simple and easy jobs - such as replacing a used flapper - that many people can do themselves in about 5 minutes.

<p>The next requirements to assess is how the backflow prevention assembly is installed. It is very important that the repair technician knows the right installation orientation and can assess the installation conditions to ensure there are no conditions circumventing the working of the assembly. The backflow prevention assembly need to be set up in the installation orientation for which it was approved. Many backflow preventers are set up in a horizontal orientation to the surrounding grade. Some (not all) backflow preventers can be set up in a vertical orientation, but it is necessary that the assembly just be set up if it is approved for that orientation. To arbitrarily take an RP and stand it on its end in a vertical orientation might cause the backflow prevention assembly to not work appropriately and no matter how many parts you put inside the assembly, it still may not work because the installation orientation is triggering the failure.</p>
