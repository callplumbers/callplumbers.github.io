<h3>How to Keep A Clogged Toilet From Becoming A Disaster in Bowling Green OH 43402</h3>
<p>Backflow indicates the undesirable reversal of circulation of a liquid, gas, or suspended solid into the potable supply of water; a backflow preventer is created to keep this from taking place. Points at which a safe and clean water system gets in touch with a non-potable water supply are called cross connections. Such connections occur naturally in devices such as clothing washers and dishwashing machines, but they must be thoroughly designed and set up to prevent backflow. Another typical place for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water main, to prevent pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the general public water system.</p>
