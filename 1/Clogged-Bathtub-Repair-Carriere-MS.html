<p>Water softeners usually have a life expectancy of 15 years, nevertheless, water softener systems can last much longer if they are correctly kept.

Iron will nasty the resin and lower its ion exchange efficiency. Resin cleaners enhance the regeneration cycle and assistance ease the resin beads of hardness-causing minerals.</p>
