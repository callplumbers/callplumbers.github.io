<p>Water softening uses a process called "ion exchange" to get rid of liquified difficult water minerals such as calcium, iron, manganese and magnesium. These minerals can't be caught by a filter, so a molecular response is required. Water softeners have resin beads that keep sodium, and as the tough water streams through the resin, the sodium is swapped for the difficult water minerals. The hard water minerals are caught in the softener and a trace quantity of sodium drains with the softened water.</p>

<p>Include an independently acting, spring-loaded check valve and a separately acting spring-loaded, air inlet valve. Though a sink is a fairly easy system as far as plumbing goes, these fixtures can encounter all kinds of problem. You need a service group that can act fast and with the utmost care, making sure a swift resolution and results that you can trust.</p>
