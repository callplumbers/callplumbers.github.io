Non-potable and safe and clean water or liquids can be required into the safe and clean supply system if these connections are not properly protected.</p>
<p>If a cable has not yet been gone to the junction box, you can make the connections within the brand-new disposer any time ahead of time, joining the cable to the wires in package just before or just after mounting the disposer.
