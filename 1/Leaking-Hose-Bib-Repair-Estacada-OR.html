<p>The on-demand gas heater can conserve as much as 35% of the energy required for heated water if your home utilizes around 45 gallons of hot water each day. They can also lower the energy required for homes with far higher needs as well. Houses that use over 80 gallons of hot water every day can conserve as much as 14% by switching to these smaller sized hot water heater.

Tough minerals caught in the resin (or zeolite) are released and the media gets renewed with salt ions. The water softener is likewise cleaned up and sanitized during regrowth. Lastly, water including the difficult minerals and other waste gets flushed out of the system.</p>
