<p>In 1939, after his Roto-Rooter sewer cleaning machine proved effective, Sam Blanc created and developed a smaller design that operated on the exact same principle but could clean and clear bathroom and kitchen sink drains as well as laundry drains and other household plumbing drains. Blanc also developed a much bigger variation of the Roto-Rooter machine called the Roto-Rooter Royal. It needed to be towed by a truck and featured a 10 hp gas engine and 1000 feet of steel cable. It was capable of cleaning large industrial and community sewer pipes. An improved variation called "The Mainliner" was presented in 1958 that could likewise thread telephone cable. It was stopped in 1973.</p>
<p>As soon as set up, these BPAs are subject to initial and regular testing and maintenance requirements to validate their continued functional efficiency. Such testing needs to be carried out by a state licensed Back-flow Prevention Assemble Tester signed up with the City of Austin. Licensing, registration and other tester-specific info is also offered online (see Backflow Prevention Assembly Tester Information ).</p>
