<p>So, what's a backflow prevention valve? This is a device that ensures non-potable water doesn't return into the main water system system. Basically, it's a device that guarantees water flows in one instructions. When you have a sewer issue, you'll want the sewer repair process to minimize disturbances to your property or service. You most likely don't wish to collect your patio, parking area or landscape.</p>
<p>A. Usually wax does not "go bad" on a basic floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to avoid leakages. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet exists to avoid smells. If you are experiencing a leak coming from underneath the floor-mounted toilet, you probably have a partial (or complete blown) toilet interruption down the drain line (or the toilet is broken in the bowl). Likewise, make sure the leak isn't coming from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "typical" undetected problem. Try putting a couple of drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a few hours if you aren't sure where the leak is coming from.</p>
<p>Martens Plumbing & Heating offers a range of sewer and drain piping repair and replacement services. A clogged sewer line can lead to a raw sewage backup out of your drains, which can cause significant problems and damage-- particularly common in older houses. Utilizing a sewer camera to examine the weak areas or clog, our extremely trained experts can quickly find the source of the problem keeping your sewer line from doing its job-- efficiently carrying wastewater to your septic system or community system.</p>
