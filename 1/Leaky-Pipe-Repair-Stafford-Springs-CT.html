<p>Viking SupplyNet's comprehensive inventory of backflow valves and associated devices includes leading products from Wilkins, Ames, Watts, and others. Oxidants such as chlorine in the public water system react with the polybutylene piping and acetal fittings, causing them to scale, flake, and end up being breakable. This leads to micro-fractures and minimizes the basic structural integrity of the system. The system becomes weak and may fail without warning, causing damage to the building structure and personal property. Inappropriate installation is also a typical cause of polybutylene system failure, which can be nearly impossible to spot.</p>
<p>Backflow prevention assemblies are developed to offer years of defense. There are numerous regional conditions that can shorten the working life of a backflow preventer.  Conditions such as extreme pressure, water temperature level, quality or turbidity can all cause the assembly to degrade in its efficiency. Some backflow prevention assemblies may rarely need repair while some are repaired on a regular basis. The test data from the field test will determine the repair frequency.</p>

<p>Test for water tightness by plugging the drain with the stopper and filling the sink with an inch of water.

Check for leakages and tighten up as needed. Plug system into a GFCI-protected receptacle, and arrange cords as desired.</p>
