There are a few food products you should probably not take into the garbage disposal though. Those products are coffee premises, corn husks, banana peels and eggshells. Another pointer to stop obstructing is to watch out for excess grease and oils.

<p>A partial reroute is essentially a little scale repiping of one or more afflicted locations of the plumbing below the slab. In cases where jackhammering and fixing the pipe are not cost effective, it is possible to just abandon the affected section of pipe and reroute the line through the walls, ceilings and attics. Costing less than a complete repipe, the end result is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that may leak again in the future. We have actually experienced homes having 2 or more slab leaks within a 1-2 year duration, and these repairs can accumulate in cost really rapidly. This is the main reason we will suggest a full repipe in particular communities, based upon our experience.</p>

Turn the disposal unit to line up the discharge tailpiece with the drain trap, and after that connect it. Relying on the existing trap configuration, you may need to replace some or all of the drain piping below the sink to accommodate the disposal.</p>
