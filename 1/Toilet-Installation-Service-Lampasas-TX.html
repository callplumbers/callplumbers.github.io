<p>Kcb plumbing contractors, Inc The majority of the houses in our area were developed before 1965, which is the time when copper piping for hot and cold water became standard. Older homes were installed with galvanized iron cut and thread pipe. Iron that comes in contact with water and oxygen will wear away. This corrosion, or rust, causes the iron to swell up and end up being flaky. In order to avoid the rusting of the iron, the pipes were dipped in zinc. The zinc bonds with the iron and produces a waterproof membrane to protect the iron from rusting.</p>

<p>Backflow is a prospective issue in a water supply because it can spread infected water back through a distribution system. For example, backflow at uncontrolled cross connections (cross-connections are any actual or prospective connection between the public water system and a source of contamination or contamination) can allow pollutants or toxins to get in the drinkable water supply. Sickness can result from consuming water that has been infected due to backflow.</p>
<p>When installed, these BPAs go through regular and initial testing and maintenance requirements to confirm their continued operational effectiveness. Such testing needs to be carried out by a state licensed Back-flow Prevention Assemble Tester signed up with the City of Austin. Licensing, registration and other tester-specific information is also available online (see Backflow Prevention Assembly Tester Information ).</p>
