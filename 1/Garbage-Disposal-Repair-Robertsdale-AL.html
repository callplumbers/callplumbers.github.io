<p>Organic particles, such as hair, food, or grease stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is typically the reason for clogged drains. The most typical way a plumber unblocks P-traps is with a tool known as a plumber's snake, cable television or drain auger. The tool is thoroughly inserted down your drain to clear it of accumulation. You can attempt to do this yourself, however this isn't a newbie's DIY task. If you utilize the tool improperly, you can harm your pipes and trigger other leakages - so it's worth it to call someone who knows the drill.</p>
<p>A clogged drain can make any of your plumbing components inoperable. Whether you have a sink that does not drain correctly or a shower that holds water for too long, a Sears Handyman can help. Sometimes drain repair requirements can be resolved fairly rapidly by a knowledgeable handyman. At other times, however, parts of a drain may need to be dismantled, taken a look at, and cleared before being replaced. Sometimes, a handyman may identify that a replacement part is essential (like a tailpiece, reducer, or PVC  trap) to guarantee normal operation for your drain. Call a Sears Handyman representative today to go over repair alternatives.</p>
