<p>As a locally-owned business, integrity and responsibility are incredibly essential to developing a credibility for quality. Section 312.10 of the Ohio Plumbing Code covers the installation, repairs and testing of isolation backflow preventers (BFP) and Section 608 of the Ohio Plumbing Code addresses security of the potable supply of water within a structure these gadgets are known as seclusion" BFP. Again, the best kind of backflow prevention is an air gap, such as the outlet of a faucet and where water would flow over the rim of a sink or bathtub. The Warren County Plumbing Department checks to guarantee there is an air space, if there is no chance to provide one, then we check to see that the appropriate BFP device is installed. These BFP's, if testable, are needed to be tested (by a certified backflow preventer tester) upon installation and a minimum of every twelve months thereafter.</p>
