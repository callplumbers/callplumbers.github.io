<p>In some cases, an untrained person will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the assumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair may be as basic as changing a couple of rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or may require the replacement of a few of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester carries out a field test, he produces information on the operations of the assembly.  It becomes the tester's task to understand what the field test information suggests for that specific assembly.  When a trained tester translates the data, he can determine what parts of the backflow prevention assembly stopped working the test and requires repair.</p>
