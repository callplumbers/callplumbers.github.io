Increases in downstream pressure can be produced by pumps, temperature level boosts in boilers, and so on.

<p>Often, an inexperienced individual will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the assumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair might be as basic as changing a couple of rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or may need the replacement of a few of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester performs a field test, he creates data on the operations of the assembly.  It ends up being the tester's task to know what the field test information suggests for that particular assembly.  When a trained tester interprets the data, he can determine what parts of the backflow prevention assembly failed the test and requires repair.</p>
