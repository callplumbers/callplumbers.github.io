The salt water is reverse flushed through the system taking with it the calcium and magnesium ions that had been adsorbed on the resin.

<p>Button Plumbing was terrific. If I shut off the water under the sink, they changed my kitchen faucet and added 2 new shut off valves under the sink which had actually constantly leaked in the previous. I pointed out that my bathroom sink was draining sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into.
