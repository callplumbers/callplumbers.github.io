<p>Clearly the resin is not an endless exchange site. When all the salt exchange websites are changed with solidity minerals, the resin is invested and will no longer soften water. At this point, the water softener will need to be operated on an alternate cycle called regeneration. During this cycle, resin is backwashed with a salt solution. The brine is reverse flushed through the system taking with it the calcium and magnesium ions that had been adsorbed on the resin. As soon as backwashing is total, the softener can be gone back to use. Some water softeners will immediately change to the operation cycle. Others have a manual switch.
