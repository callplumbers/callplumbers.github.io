<p>When drains are clogged, it is not always due to blockages that come from inside the house. It is possible for drains to end up being clogged due to tree roots, also referred to as tree root intrusion. When tree roots start to make their method inside somebody's main sewer line, there is potential for this to cause drain problems. The type of drain pipes currently installed, such as cast iron, plastic, copper or clay, will figure out the degree of the damage that tree roots can cause to a sewer line.</p>

The company must get a permit prior to trenching. How often a backflow preventer needs to be checked depends upon its type.

<p>A cross-connection is any momentary or permanent connection between a public water supply or customer's safe and clean (i.e., drinking) water system and any source or system consisting of nonpotable water or other compounds. An example is the piping between a public water supply or consumer's safe and clean water supply and an auxiliary water system, cooling system or irrigation system.</p>
<p>Your garbage disposal ensures that your sink and plumbing fixtures do not get clogged. Contrary to some individuals's understanding, waste disposal unit do not consist of blades. Instead, a waste disposal unit includes two stationary bolts that are fixed to a spinning disk. When the disposal is turned on the disks rapidly spin, and these bolts require food and particles to grind against a stationary grinder along the periphery of the spinning disk. This high-speed action effectively crushes the food waste in the disposal so that it can take a trip down the drain without blocking.</p>
