<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow triggered by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or customer's drinkable water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the drinkable water system pressure) can result from a boost in downstream pressure, a reduction in the safe and clean water supply pressure, or a mix of both. Pumps can develop increases in downstream pressure; temperature boosts in boilers, and so on. Decreases in potable water system pressure take place whenever the amount of water being utilized exceeds the amount of water being provided, such as during water line flushing, fire combating, or breaks in water mains.</p>
