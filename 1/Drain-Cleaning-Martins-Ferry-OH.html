<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow triggered by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or customer's drinkable water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the drinkable supply of water pressure) can result from an increase in downstream pressure, a reduction in the safe and clean supply of water pressure, or a mix of both. Pumps can produce increases in downstream pressure; temperature boosts in boilers, etc. Decreases in safe and clean water system pressure occur whenever the amount of water being utilized surpasses the quantity of water being provided, such as throughout water line flushing, fire fighting, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
