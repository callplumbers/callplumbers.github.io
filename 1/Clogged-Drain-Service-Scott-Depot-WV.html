<p>Eventually, however, the beads reach maximum capacity and can't bring in any more mineral ions. At that point, the softener tank should be restored, or, flushed clean. That's where the brine tank is available in. An on-board computer system computes the quantity of water that streams through the softener. Regrowth immediately begins when it reaches the preprogrammed setting. For a three-bedroom home and family of four, regrowth generally happens every 12,000 gallons.</p>
<p>The mineral tank is the chamber where the hard water is softened. The supply of water line feeds the tough water into the tank. The water seeps through the bed of resin beads, transferring the water-hardening calcium and magnesium ions. The water exits the tank soft and streams through your pipes and out to your household home appliances. Backflow is a term used in the plumbing world to explain an unwanted circulation of water in the reverse instructions.
