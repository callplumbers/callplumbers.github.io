<p>Identifying if you need a water softener is a personal preference. Water softener systems work by eliminating hardness minerals and changing them with salt ions. Water conditioners are devices that help prevent the hardness-forming minerals from forming scale. They use a physical media to prevent the scale from developing by reducing the effects of the solidity itself. Due to the fact that water conditioners utilize a physical media rather of a chemical media, they are often considered a greener alternative in areas where it is forbidden to utilize salt. Water conditioners do not effectively get rid of solidity from the water supply, nevertheless, as the only way to do this is with a salt-based media.</p>
