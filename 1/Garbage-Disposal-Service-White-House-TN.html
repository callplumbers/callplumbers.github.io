<p>Also called a garbage disposer, a garbage disposal is available in two fundamental types - continuous feed, which usually has a wall-mounted switch so the unit keeps running as you drop more waste in; and batch feed, which requires a food cover remain in place to operate the unit. Continuous feed is common and the easiest to use; a batch feed model is safer but can be slower to utilize on large amounts of food waste due to the fact that you need to process it in batches. An Ohio plumbing supply company offers an introduction of garbage disposal types and designs.</p>
