<p>When utilized in combating a fire, fire department connections can be a problem. Firemen by and big are not interested in backflow prevention problems. They are worrying about safeguarding individuals's lives and to a lower level their home.

You can attempt a non-abrasive toilet bowl cleaner if that does not work. A number of these cleaners contain focused levels of hydrocloric acid, which can be very hazardous if it is available in contact with skin, eyes, or lungs. Please ensure to take the appropriate safety measures if using one of these products.</p>
