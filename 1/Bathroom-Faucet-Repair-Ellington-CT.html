<p>The discharge tube included in the disposer set will be connected to the disposer using the plate, gasket and screws initially meant for the disposer discharge elbow. If your set just consists of a waste arm, it is possible - though not recommended - to connect this to the disposer discharge elbow utilizing a slip joint. The consecutive 90 ° turns in such a setup can lead to improper drainage. Depending upon the length of the waste arm, you might have the ability to cut off its elbow and utilize the remainder as a straight discharge tube.</p>
