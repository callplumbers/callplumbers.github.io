<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow triggered by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or consumer's drinkable water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the drinkable water system pressure) can arise from a boost in downstream pressure, a reduction in the safe and clean supply of water pressure, or a mix of both. Pumps can develop boosts in downstream pressure; temperature boosts in boilers, and so on. Reductions in potable water supply pressure take place whenever the quantity of water being utilized goes beyond the amount of water being provided, such as during water line flushing, fire battling, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
