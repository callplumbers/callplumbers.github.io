<p>However, most of the time, it's safe to state that any repairs that need to be finished will come out of the wallet of a house owner. Plumbing Codes and State law dictate minimum standards for backflow prevention. Public water supply such as the City Utilities Department need to meet or exceed the state requirements and bring the obligation for enforcing them.</p>
<p>We have an inspection program to determine water sources and situations that need backflow prevention gadgets. For residential property, it is necessary for owners to alert the District if any modifications are made, such as digging a new well. For commercial residential or commercial property, the District reviews making use of each new occupant. The correction should be made prior to water service is allowed if the current backflow is not up to District code. Cost for the device is covered by either the occupant or the residential or commercial property owner.</p>
<p>Sometimes, an inexperienced individual will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the presumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair may be as easy as replacing a couple of rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or may need the replacement of some of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester carries out a field test, he creates data on the workings of the assembly.  It becomes the tester's task to understand what the field test data suggests for that specific assembly.  When an experienced tester translates the information, he can identify what parts of the backflow prevention assembly stopped working the test and requires repair.</p>
