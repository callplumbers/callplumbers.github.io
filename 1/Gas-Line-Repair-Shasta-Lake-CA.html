<p>Viking SupplyNet's extensive inventory of backflow valves and associated gadgets includes leading products from Wilkins, Ames, Watts, and others. Oxidants such as chlorine in the public water system react with the polybutylene piping and acetal fittings, triggering them to scale, flake, and end up being breakable. This results in micro-fractures and decreases the basic structural stability of the system. The system ends up being weak and may stop working without warning, causing damage to the building structure and personal property. Incorrect installation is also a typical reason for polybutylene system failure, which can be almost difficult to detect.</p>
