<p>Backflow Preventer: A device that allows water to go through it in one instructions, however avoids it from reversing in the opposite instructions. You have long-term water solidity if you do not see limescale build-up but instead see soap residue, your washing cleaning agents not working as effectively or your skin getting delicate and itchy. If you smell gas, do not attempt to find the leak. Instead, leave your home or structure immediately.
