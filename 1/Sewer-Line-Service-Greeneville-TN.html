<p>The trick to avoiding a clogged garbage disposal is small amounts. As long as the food waste is sent through the disposal at a reasonable amount, there need to be no issue in getting the majority of the waste through. There are a few food products you ought to most likely not take into the garbage disposal though. Those products are coffee grounds, corn husks, banana peels and eggshells.
