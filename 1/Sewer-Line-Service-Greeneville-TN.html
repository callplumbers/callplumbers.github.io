<p>The trick to avoiding a clogged garbage disposal is small amounts. As long as the food waste is sent through the disposal at a reasonable amount, there need to be no issue in getting the majority of the waste through. There are a few food products you ought to most likely not take into the garbage disposal though. Those products are coffee grounds, corn husks, banana peels and eggshells. Another tip to stop blocking is to look out for excess grease and oils. Those fluids will solidify when they cool so it is best to wash pots and pans that have those liquids under warm water and to continue to let the water run for several seconds after you are finished cleaning to make sure the drain is clear.</p>
