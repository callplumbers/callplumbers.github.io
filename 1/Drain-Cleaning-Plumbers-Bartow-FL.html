<p>Echologics has a long history of establishing acclaimed acoustic innovations for leak detection on buried water pipelines. Running a camera through the household sewer pipes (normally from the house to its connection to the general public sewer system) can be utilized to examine the type and condition of underground pipes, and to determine problems like leaking or broken joints, intruding roots, clogs, corrosion or collapsed pipes. Homeowners might have a video inspection done to discover the cause of periodic sewer backups or other ongoing problems, or when selling or buying an older house.</p>
