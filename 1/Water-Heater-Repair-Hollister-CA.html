<p>Aside from these 2 essential parts, there are a myriad of little, possibly less crucial things that can deteriorate or break. For example, if you lose your toilet bowl bolt covers (those little caps on the base of the toilet), the bolts holding your toilet to the floor will corrode much more rapidly. Constant gross smells originating from the toilet can indicate you need a brand-new wax ring where your toilet attaches to the floor drain. If the float rod of your fill valve isn't lifting appropriately, you may need a brand-new cap for the fill valve. Bulges in the supply line can cause a leak and burst. If mishandled, tank lids can crack and leave your toilet's inner functions exposed. While this won't impact the function of your toilet, it certainly does not do much for the visual of your bathroom. We're not attempting to psych you out by discussing all the important things that can fail, the point is - your toilet is a total fixture and every part needs to be in excellent shape for it to function at its best.</p>

A high-efficiency toilet with extra features can cost $ 800 to $1,500 to install. The average installation takes a plumber 2 to 4 hours at $ 65 per hour. If you're changing an existing toilet, include $ 30 to $50 to remove your old toilet.</p>

The very best strainers have either a spin-lock or a twist-and-drop design stopper. The spin-lock stopper doesn't have any parts that can wear, but screwing it in and out can be irritating.
