<p>The brine tank aids the water softening system in regeneration. It is a much shorter tank that sits surrounding to the mineral tank. The brine tank holds a highly concentrated solution of salt (or in some cases potassium) to bring back the resin beads' favorable charge. Salt is manually added to the salt water tank in the type of pellets or blocks. These dissolve in the water at the bottom of the tank. When the control valve registers the softening capability of the resin is decreasing, the heavy salt water solution is drawn out of the tank and flushed through the resin in the mineral tank.
