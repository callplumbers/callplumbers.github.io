<p>Loose flanges are normally the outcome of wood rot. The flange screws simply will not hold in the soft, decayed subfloor. The very best service depends on the level of the rot. Utilize an ear-type repair ring if the rot is only under the flange. The ears let you drive screws into company wood farther away from the flange. Prior to you install this type of ring, hold it as much as the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You might have to cut off a couple of ears to make it deal with your toilet.
