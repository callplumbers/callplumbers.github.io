For instance, if you lose your toilet bowl bolt covers (those little caps on the base of the toilet), the bolts holding your toilet to the floor will rust far more rapidly. Constant gross smells originating from the toilet can indicate you need a brand-new wax ring where your toilet attaches to the floor drain.

Tank covers can crack and leave your toilet's inner functions exposed if mishandled.

We're not attempting to psych you out by pointing out all the important things that can go wrong, the point is - your toilet is a total component and every part needs to be in great shape for it to operate at its best.</p>
