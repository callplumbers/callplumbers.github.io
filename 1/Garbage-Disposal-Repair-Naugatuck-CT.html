<p>Your waste disposal unit makes sure that your sink and plumbing fixtures don't get clogged. Contrary to some individuals's perception, garbage disposals do not consist of blades.

This high-speed action effectively pulverizes the food waste in the disposal so that it can take a trip down the drain without clogging.</p>
