<p>Water softening uses a process called "ion exchange" to eliminate dissolved tough water minerals such as calcium, magnesium, iron and manganese. These minerals can't be caught by a filter, so a molecular reaction is needed. Water softeners have resin beads that hold onto salt, and as the tough water flows through the resin, the sodium is switched for the tough water minerals. The tough water minerals are trapped in the softener and a trace amount of salt drains with the softened water.</p>
<p>Depending upon your water quality, some softeners might be able to fully or partially get rid of copper, manganese, iron, and radium, in addition to calcium and magnesium.

These softeners may have unique filter media and may cost more than typical softeners. Before utilizing a softener for this function, follow the suggestions listed in the house Water Treatment.</p>
