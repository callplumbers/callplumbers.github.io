<p>The pipe-bursting technique is used on pipes that are severely damaged, for replacing a whole pipe system, or for fixing larger areas of sewer pipeline The installers need physical access to the pipe in order to begin repair, which includes 2 four foot square access pits at either end of the pipeline.

As it makes its way through the system, breaking the old pipe apart and attracting a brand-new smooth pipe behind it.
