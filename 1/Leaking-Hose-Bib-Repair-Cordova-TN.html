If you are presently experiencing any flooding on your residential or commercial property when it rains, then there is a likelihood that the storm drain is clogged and for that reason needs to be cleared out. If a clogged storm drain is not addressed in a prompt way, the possibilities are high that it will trigger extra damage to the storm pipe, which will need repair.</p>
