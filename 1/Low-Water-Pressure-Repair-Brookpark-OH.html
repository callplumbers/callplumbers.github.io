Variations in line pressure, downstream or upstream, will trigger a properly functioning RPZ assembly to periodically discharge percentages of water.

Adequate drainage should also be offered.</p>

<p>Deluge systems are developed so that all the sprinkler heads are open and the piping is not pressurized. These systems generally are set up in areas where the possibility of an extreme fire condition is likely, such as aircraft hangars. Water to the system is kept back by the deluge valve, which is linked to a fire detection system. If a fire takes place, the detection system sends out a signal that opens the deluge valve, which then enables water to discharge from all of the sprinklers on the system.</p>
