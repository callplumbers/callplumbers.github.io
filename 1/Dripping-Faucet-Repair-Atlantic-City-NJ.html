It was installed 7 years ago, and it never ever drained this well. I chose this company due to the fact that they had fantastic evaluations and a fair rate, and even though the task took a lot more time and work than they anticipated it to, they honored their quote. I will use Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing requires in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were monsters. They had a huge, disgusting mess on their hands (literally), and they did an excellent job tidying up after it too.</p>
