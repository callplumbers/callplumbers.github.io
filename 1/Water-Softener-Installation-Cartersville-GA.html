<p>Each component of the assembly must be checked to identify what needs repair. The field test might not constantly reveal you the severity of the failure or whether repair parts beyond the basic rubber repair set are necessary.

Most fire sprinkler heads, except sprinkler heads on a deluge system are kept closed by a heat-sensitive operating mechanism. Normally, this operating mechanism is either a fusible link or a glass bulb.  Regardless of the operating system, just the sprinklers that are exposed to heat will open throughout a fire.</p>
