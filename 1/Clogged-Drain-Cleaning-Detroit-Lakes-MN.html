<p>Plainly the resin is not an inexhaustible exchange site. When all the salt exchange sites are changed with firmness minerals, the resin is invested and will no longer soften water. At this moment, the water softener will need to be operated on an alternate cycle called regrowth. Throughout this cycle, resin is backwashed with a salt service. The salt water is reverse flushed through the system taking with it the calcium and magnesium ions that had actually been adsorbed on the resin. The softener can be returned to use once backwashing is total. Some water softeners will automatically switch to the operation cycle. Others have a manual switch.
