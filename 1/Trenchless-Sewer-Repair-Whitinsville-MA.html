<p>In some households, using a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog may be the go-to approach when searching for a feasible service, particularly when basic plunging doesn't appear to work. However, there are many downsides to utilizing these dangerous products - not least of which is that they generally include compounds such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by liquifying whatever is triggering an obstruction, which can range from the usual suspects like hair or food to mineral accumulation, little things, dirt, and even roots in cases where broken pipes on your property draw the attention of plant life. The strength of these chemicals makes them effective, but at the cost of presenting the risk of damage to your house and household.</p>
