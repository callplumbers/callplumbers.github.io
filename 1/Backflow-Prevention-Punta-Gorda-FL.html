<p>An overall repipe of a home's water supply, frequently done to replace leaking polybutylene pipes, is the most elaborate and expensive plumbing job, says Steven Wood, president of Flo-Right Services, a plumbing company specializing in whole house repiping.

Just 4" of water pressure can be enough to obstruct a natural gas line. Sound-- Gradually sediment can develop in the bottom of your tank.

<p>Rusting and corrosion on the exterior of the hot water heater, inlet pipes, or parts can indicate a prospective problem with the water heater. If it is more than 6 or 7 years old, it can likewise suggest the water heater is near the end of its life.
