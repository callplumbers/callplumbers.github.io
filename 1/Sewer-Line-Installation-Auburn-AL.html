<p>Pieces that comprise kitchen sink drains can end up being worn and rusty, resulting in leakages. Depending on the severity of the situation, only one piece might need replacement, or the entire under-sink assembly needs to be gotten rid of and changed. Parts involved include slip nut joints and washers, tubing leading from the sink, P-trap or S-trap assemblies and sink drain baskets. Poorly set up P-traps or S-traps that are propped up or are not protected by nut joints and washers, should be reconfigured.</p>
