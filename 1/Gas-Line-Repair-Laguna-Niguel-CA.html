The membrane has pores large enough to admit water molecules for passage; hardness ions such as Ca2+ and Mg2+ will not fit through the pores. The resulting soft supply of water is free of hardness ions with no other ions being added. Membranes are a kind of water filter needing routine cleaning or replacement maintenance.</p>
