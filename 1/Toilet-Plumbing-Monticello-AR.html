<p>Your kitchen sink is an integral part of your home, that makes its plumbing's efficient working a necessity more than a need. Once the test results reveal the repair is total, it is time to re-pressurize the plumbing system that was isolated throughout the repair process. It is very important that the plumbing system be switched on very gradually to guarantee no damage is done to the piping system. Once the system is pressurized, air should be eliminated from the plumbing system. When re-pressurized, each outlet on the plumbing system need to be checked to guarantee no valves were accidentally left open or did not close correctly. When the plumbing system is pressurized, be sure all valves are completely open and alert the water user that the plumbing system has been returned to service.</p>
