<p>Backpressure might occur when the drinkable supply piping is linked to a system or component which goes beyond the operating pressure of the supply piping. Greater pressure can be caused by booster pumps, boilers, pressure vessels, or raised piping in places such as high-rise buildings or tanks. If these connections are not effectively protected, non-potable and safe and clean water or liquids can be forced into the drinkable supply system.</p>
<p>Supply of water by the water company consists of some amounts of damaging chemicals like arsenic and lead. Water filtration systems remove these pollutants to make drinking water clean, clear and tastier. As such, water filtration systems are essential requirements, not optional expenses.
