Again, the very best kind of backflow prevention is an air gap, such as the outlet of a faucet and where water would flow over the rim of a sink or bathtub. The Warren County Plumbing Department checks to guarantee there is an air gap, if there is no other way to provide one, then we inspect to see that the proper BFP device is set up.

<p>Fire department connections can be a problem when used in fighting a fire. Firemen by and big are not interested in backflow prevention problems. They are worrying about securing individuals's lives and to a lesser level their residential or commercial property. Getting the necessary volume of water on a fire is their objective and they will utilize water from any source available to attain that objective. This can develop cross-connection control problems and may as a result indicate that the level of security on the fire security system might need to be increased to a high risk defense level.</p>
<p>The Delaware Department of Public Health Plumbing License and Inspection Program has offices in Kent and Sussex Counties. For example, a water-main break or the opening of a fire hydrant can cause water pipes to lose pressure. When that occurs, water is no longer pressed forward into the property, allowing it to stream backward into city water materials.</p>
