<p>A total repipe of a home's water supply, often done to replace leaking polybutylene pipes, is the most detailed and costly plumbing task, states Steven Wood, president of Flo-Right Services, a plumbing company specializing in entire house repiping. Recent Review: Carlos and Lopez were incredible. My 90 year old Dad's sewer line clogged on Thanksgiving Day and Carlos reached 8am the next day to repair. Due to the fact that of the age of the house and area of the pipe, it was a hard task. They worked for almost 12 hours into darkness to make sure the system was working before they left. I am genuinely grateful for their effort and professionalism.</p>
