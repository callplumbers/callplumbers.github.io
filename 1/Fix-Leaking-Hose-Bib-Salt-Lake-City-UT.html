<p>A minimized pressure zone backflow device (RPZ) is a testable kind of backflow prevention device that is set up in high danger" applications. The RPZ is similar to the DC. It has 2 spring checks, but also has a 3rd check valve that is in fact a vent open up to atmosphere on the bottom of the valve (kept closed by the water pressure). The reason it is used in high-risk scenarios is due to the fact that if the very first check valve ever malfunctions, the bottom of the valve then drains and opens. This relief valve uses an extra layer of security compared to the DC, which will permit backflow if both check valves breakdown. This is the reason that when you check an RPZ, you force water to backflow to ensure the RPZ discharges.</p>
