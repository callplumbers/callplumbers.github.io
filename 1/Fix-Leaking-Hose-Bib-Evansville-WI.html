<p>Often, an inexperienced individual will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the presumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair may be as easy as changing a few rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or might require the replacement of some of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester performs a field test, he creates data on the workings of the assembly.  It ends up being the tester's task to know what the field test information means for that particular assembly.  When an experienced tester analyzes the data, he can identify what parts of the backflow prevention assembly stopped working the test and needs repair.</p>
