<p>Nearly all softeners fall under one of two categories. Timed designs have programmable timeclocks that will restore on a predetermined schedule and after that go back to service. These work well for homes that are on routine water-using cycles but will waste more water and salt due to the fact that they regrow whether the resin requires it or not. Demand-control models, with either electrical and mechanical sensing units, usually restore after numerous gallons of water have been softened. Such models are hassle-free if you have a rising and falling water use schedule.</p>
