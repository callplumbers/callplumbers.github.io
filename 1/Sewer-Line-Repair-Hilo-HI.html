Points at which a drinkable water supply connects with a non-potable water system are called cross connections. Such connections take place naturally in home appliances such as clothing washers and dishwashing machines, however they should be thoroughly created and set up to avoid backflow. Another common location for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water pipe, to avoid pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the general public supply of water.</p>
