It is necessary to understand that RPZ assemblies, while more reliable, experience much higher pressure and volume loss than double-check assemblies. Variations in line pressure, upstream or downstream, will prompt an effectively working RPZ assembly to periodically discharge percentages of water.

Boosts in downstream pressure can be created by pumps, temperature boosts in boilers, etc. Reductions in safe and clean water supply pressure happen whenever the amount of water being used goes beyond the amount of water being provided, such as throughout water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>
<p>Clearly the resin is not an inexhaustible exchange website. When all the sodium exchange sites are replaced with firmness minerals, the resin is spent and will no longer soften water.

The brine is reverse flushed through the system taking with it the calcium and magnesium ions that had been adsorbed on the resin. The softener can be returned to utilize as soon as backwashing is total. Some water softeners will instantly change to the operation cycle. Others have a manual switch.
