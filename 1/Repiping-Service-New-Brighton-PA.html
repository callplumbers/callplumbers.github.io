It is necessary to understand that RPZ assemblies, while more reliable, experience much higher pressure and volume loss than double-check assemblies. Variations in line pressure, upstream or downstream, will prompt an effectively working RPZ assembly to periodically discharge percentages of water.

Boosts in downstream pressure can be created by pumps, temperature boosts in boilers, etc. Reductions in safe and clean water supply pressure happen whenever the amount of water being used goes beyond the amount of water being provided, such as throughout water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>
