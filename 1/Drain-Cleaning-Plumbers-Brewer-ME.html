Pumps can create increases in downstream pressure; temperature level boosts in boilers, and so on. Reductions in drinkable water supply pressure take place whenever the quantity of water being used surpasses the amount of water being provided, such as throughout water line flushing, fire combating, or breaks in water mains.</p>
