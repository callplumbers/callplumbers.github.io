<p>The program achieves its mission by attending to the adoption and promulgation of suitable guidelines and regulations for the building and construction of plumbing centers where mandated. Cold showers? High energy expenses? It may be time for a new warm water heater. However in order to profit of a new energy-efficient device, you'll need to have it set up correctly. A water heater that is not set up properly can lead to water damage, scalding temperatures, or even a fire. That's why installation is best delegated professional plumbers who know the ins and outs of your plumbing system.</p>
