In cases where fixing the pipe and jackhammering are not cost effective, it is possible to only desert the affected area of pipe and reroute the line through the walls, ceilings and attics. Costing less than a full repipe, the end result is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that may leak once again in the future. We have experienced houses having 2 or more slab leaks within a 1-2 year period, and these repairs can accumulate in cost really rapidly. This is the main reason we will advise a complete repipe in specific neighborhoods, based upon our experience.</p>
