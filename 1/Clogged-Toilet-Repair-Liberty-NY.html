From a health perspective, these minerals have no adverse effects and are, in reality, necessary daily nutrients. It is minerals that give water the rejuvenating flavor many individuals discover desirable. Nevertheless, when calcium and magnesium penetrate water, they buildup on contact surface areas, perhaps plug pipes and damage water heaters, and decrease the efficiency of cleaning agents and soaps.
