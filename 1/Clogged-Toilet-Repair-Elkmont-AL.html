<p>It can clog pipes and soap will dissolve in it less quickly when water is hard. Water softening can prevent these negative impacts. Natural gas is a colorless, odor-free fuel. As a security preventative measure, we add a chemical odorant called mercaptan that provides natural gas an odor often associated with rotten eggs. If it takes place, this distinct fragrance permits you to smell a prospective leak. Always leave if you think a leak.</p>
<p>Water softeners normally have a life expectancy of 15 years, however, water softener systems can last much longer if they are properly maintained. Making certain the brine tank never ever lacks salt will extend the unit's life.  Securing the resin bed from high levels of iron and manganese will also safeguard the unit. Iron will foul the resin and lower its ion exchange efficiency. Resin cleaners improve the regrowth cycle and help eliminate the resin beads of hardness-causing minerals.</p>
