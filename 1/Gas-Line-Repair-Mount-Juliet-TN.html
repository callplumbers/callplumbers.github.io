Most of toilets are basic sized - implying a "will fit" seat suffices for safety and convenience. Some toilets, however, have actually uniquely formed bowls and need a particular seat, like the Eljer Symbol. It really isn't a good concept to utilize a toilet seat that is either much too big or much to little, unless they have actually been specifically designed to fit regular toilets, as the toilet seat can wobble and trigger you to move around, or will not distribute your weight uniformly and could ultimately cause cracks in the bowl.</p>
