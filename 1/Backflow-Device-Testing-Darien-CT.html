<p>Once the hardware parts have been cleaned up and examined and the rubber parts have been replaced, now reassemble the parts back into their elements. Some elements may have very tight tolerances that have to be preserved. An essential thing to identify on each part is the guide. The guide is the part that steadies the movement or directs of the element. The guide is a really crucial part of the design of each component. If the part is not repaired properly, the guide might limit the motion (rather than consistent or direct) of the component, which could cause the element to not work to its abilities. Many times springs are erroneously blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. In many cases the guides are limiting the travel of the element triggering lower test results than what is needed.</p>
