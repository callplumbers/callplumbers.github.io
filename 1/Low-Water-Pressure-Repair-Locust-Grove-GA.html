This is an option to consider if you live in an older house - such as one constructed pre-1970 - or any house with galvanized steel plumbing. Steel was the most popular choice for house plumbing for numerous years, however steel ultimately struggles with corrosion and lacks the toughness of today's copper, PEX, and CPVC piping.</p>
