<p>Backpressure might happen when the potable supply piping is linked to a system or fixture which exceeds the operating pressure of the supply piping. Greater pressure can be caused by booster pumps, boilers, pressure vessels, or elevated piping in locations such as high-rise buildings or tanks. Non-potable and potable water or liquids can be required into the safe and clean supply system if these connections are not properly secured.</p>
<p>When utilized in battling a fire, fire department connections can be an issue. Firemen by and big are not worried about backflow prevention issues. They are interesting in protecting people's lives and to a lesser extent their property. Getting the needed volume of water on a fire is their objective and they will use water from any source offered to achieve that goal. This can develop cross-connection control problems and might as an outcome imply that the level of security on the fire protection system might need to be increased to a high hazard defense level.</p>
