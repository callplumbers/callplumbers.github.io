<h3>Golden Rules To Follow In Plumbing Emergencies Lake Stevens WA</h3>
<p>Contrary to what numerous believe, having a waste disposal unit in fact protects your pipes and extends their lifespan. Food washed down a drain inadvertently or on purpose without a disposal can get stuck in pipe turns, causing blockages and gradually damaging your plumbing system. Tiny food particles produced by a waste disposal unit wash directly down quickly.</p>
<p>Button Plumbing was fantastic. If I shut off the water under the sink, they replaced my kitchen faucet and included two new shut off valves under the sink which had constantly leaked in the past. I pointed out that my bathroom sink was draining sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were really friendly and got the work done rapidly. The cost was rather reasonable. I will certainly use them for any future plumbing needs. I was very pleased with their service.</p>
