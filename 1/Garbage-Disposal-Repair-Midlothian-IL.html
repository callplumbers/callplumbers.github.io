<p>Kcb plumbing contractors, Inc The majority of the houses in our area were constructed prior to 1965, which is the time when copper piping for cold and hot water ended up being basic. Older houses were installed with galvanized iron cut and thread pipe. Iron that can be found in contact with water and oxygen will rust. This corrosion, or rust, triggers the iron to swell up and end up being flaky. In order to prevent the rusting of the iron, the pipes were dipped in zinc. The zinc bonds with the iron and creates a waterproof membrane to secure the iron from rusting.</p>
