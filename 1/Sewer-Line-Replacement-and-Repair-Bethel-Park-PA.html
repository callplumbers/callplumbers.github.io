<h3>Sewer Drain in Bethel Park Pennsylvania</h2>
<p>Water softening utilizes a procedure called "ion exchange" to remove liquified difficult water minerals such as calcium, manganese, magnesium and iron. These minerals can't be caught by a filter, so a molecular response is required.

<p>Deluge systems are created so that all the sprinkler heads are open and the piping is not pressurized. These systems usually are set up in areas where the possibility of a severe fire condition is likely, such as aircraft hangars.

If a fire occurs, the detection system sends a signal that opens the deluge valve, which then permits water to release from all of the sprinklers on the system.</p>
