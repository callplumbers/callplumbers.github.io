<p>Your storm drains don't go straight into the ground and into oblivion either, this water is generally funnelled somewhere else to a neighboring treatment plant, a creek, or perhaps the ocean in. Through the storm drain system there are long, flat areas of pipe that can be susceptible to blocking since there simply isn't enough a high adequate flow to flush out the debris.</p>
