<h3>What To Do During Emergency Plumbing Situations Hartsville SC</h3>
<p>Also called a garbage disposer, a garbage disposal comes in two basic types - constant feed, which typically has a wall-mounted switch so the unit keeps running as you drop more waste in; and batch feed, which needs a food cover be in place to operate the unit.
