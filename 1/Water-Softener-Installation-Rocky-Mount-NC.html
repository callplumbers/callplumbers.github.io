<p>Drain blockages in bathroom sinks can occur with time from the accumulation of hair, littles soap and fibers from towels that collects within pipes. As a clog becomes larger gradually, it obstructs the pipe, stopping water from draining pipes properly.

<p>Tankless Hot water heater - provide hot water as needed without a tank. The activation of a faucet requiring hot water activates the heater and water is warmed as it flows through a heating coil or heat exchanger. Cooking oil and other greases need to never be put down the waste disposal unit because they can hinder the blades. Last but not least, cold water needs to be running when the garbage disposal is on and must continue to run for 30 seconds after the disposal is switched off to ensure that all food particles have actually been washed through the pipes.</p>

This high-speed action effectively pulverizes the food waste in the disposal so that it can travel down the drain without clogging.</p>
