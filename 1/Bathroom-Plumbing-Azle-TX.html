<p>Nearly all softeners fall into one of 2 classifications. Timed models have programmable timeclocks that will restore on an established schedule and then go back to service. Since they restore whether the resin requires it or not, these work well for households that are on regular water-using cycles but will lose more water and salt.

Such models are practical if you have a rising and falling water use schedule.</p>
