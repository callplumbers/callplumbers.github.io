<p>Viking SupplyNet's extensive stock of backflow valves and related devices includes leading items from Wilkins, Ames, Watts, and others. Oxidants such as chlorine in the public water system react with the polybutylene piping and acetal fittings, triggering them to scale, flake, and end up being brittle. This leads to micro-fractures and minimizes the standard structural stability of the system. The system becomes weak and might stop working without caution, triggering damage to the building structure and personal property. Improper installation is also a common reason for polybutylene system failure, which can be nearly difficult to discover.</p>

Our repair processes rely on having a clean, smooth pipeline, otherwise, imperfections caused by waste buildup can prevent the liner from sticking to the walls properly. We clean the sewer lines with hydro jetting, a service that permits a comprehensive cleaning by blasting streams of hot, pressurized water directly into the line. The special nozzle attached to the hose directs the water in all instructions to enable the water to cover the entire diameter of the sewer line and supply a careful cleaning.</p>
