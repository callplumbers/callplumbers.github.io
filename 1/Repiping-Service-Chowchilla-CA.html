<p>The City of Bellingham requires a backflow preventer on any cross-connection or possible cross-connection. The backflow preventer may be needed on the water service line, within the building, or in both locations. The backflow preventer you choose must be listed on the Washington State Department of Health's Approved Backflow Prevention Assembly List. Assemblies not currently listed need to have been noted at the time of the original installation.</p>
<p>There are a couple of alternatives when it comes to fixing a broken or stopping working sewer line. The ideal choice for your house will depend on a few aspects, including the age of your existing pipes, the degree of damage, and your budget plan. An approved backflow prevention device, which must be evaluated annually, must be installed on the service connection that the department has recognized as having a potential for backflow.</p>
<p>Wet pipe systems are installed in areas where the ambient temperature is kept at or above 40 Â° F. When a sprinkler is activated by heat from a fire, water flows immediately from the sprinkler head. These systems have water in the pipe at all times. In scenarios where there is a need to provide sprinklers in an unheated area, such as a small loading dock, an antifreeze system can be utilized. The addition of this chemical additive will require the installation of a high hazard defense assembly.</p>
