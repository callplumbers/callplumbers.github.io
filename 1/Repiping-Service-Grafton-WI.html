<p>Hellenbrand water softeners and conditioners get rid of calcium and magnesium from your water, leaving it softer and cleaner. Simply put, soft water conserves you cash. Reduced Pressure Backflow Prevention Assembly (RP): An RP is a mechanical backflow preventer that consists of 2 separately acting, spring-loaded check valves with a hydraulically operating, mechanically independent, spring-loaded pressure differential relief valve between the check valves and below the first check valve.</p>
<p>Any time the pressure on the residential or commercial property (downstream) side goes beyond the pressure on the city side, the 2 redundant check valves close-- avoiding any backflow. However, while DCV systems are thought about safe for a lot of fire protection systems, they do have a defect: if both valves fail or debris in the water line avoids them from closing totally, backflow can happen.</p>
