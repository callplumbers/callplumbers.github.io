<p>You live in an older home. There's a great possibility that you'll need to have it done quickly if your house is 50 years old or older and you have actually never replaced its pipes. Galvanized pipes were usually installed in homes of this age, and these types of pipes are understood to rust and burst when they get old. You might need to add a grounded outlet to power the garbage disposal if you do not currently have one if so. This generally includes anywhere from $75 to $150+ to the total cost of the garbage disposal installation.</p>
<p>In the meantime, however, we recommend you first try using non-harsh and non-abrasive white vinegar and lemon juice with baking soda. Simply pour a cup of baking soda into your toilet bowl, include some white vinegar and lemon juice, and let the mix sit for a while. If that does not work, you can try a non-abrasive toilet bowl cleaner. Many of these cleaners consist of focused levels of hydrocloric acid, which can be very hazardous if it can be found in contact with skin, eyes, or lungs. If using one of these products, please make sure to take the appropriate preventative measures.</p>
