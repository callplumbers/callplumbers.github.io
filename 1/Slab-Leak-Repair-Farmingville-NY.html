<p>Unusual Sounds - If uncommon gurgling is coming from your drain, it probably requires a comprehensive cleaning. When food or waste clog your drains, it makes it hard for the water to go through. Due to the fact that of the tight area, the pipes often make odd gurgling noises as water attempts to go through a clogged pipe. This triggers the water to bubble, as only little pockets of air are available, resulting in the unusual noises emanating from your sink.</p>
<p>Chelation: Another approach is to present a chemical compound that acts as a chelating representative. Magnesium and calcium bind to this chelating agent and stay suspended in the water rather than building up on surface areas.
