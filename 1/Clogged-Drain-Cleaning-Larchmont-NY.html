<p>Button Plumbing was great. They replaced my kitchen faucet and included two new shut off valves under the sink which had constantly leaked in the past if I turned off the water under the sink. I discussed that my bathroom sink was draining sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were extremely friendly and got the work done rapidly. The price was quite sensible. I will certainly use them for any future plumbing needs. I was super pleased with their service.</p>

<p>Backflow means the unwanted reversal of circulation of a liquid, gas, or suspended strong into the safe and clean water system; a backflow preventer is created to keep this from occurring. Points at which a safe and clean water supply connects with a non-potable water system are called cross connections. Such connections happen naturally in appliances such as clothing washers and dishwashing machines, but they need to be thoroughly developed and set up to prevent backflow. Another common place for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water pipe, to avoid pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the general public water system.</p>
