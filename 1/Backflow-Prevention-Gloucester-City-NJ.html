As useful as this gas is, the functions that make this gas unsafe is its odorless and colorless nature, that makes it a quiet killer. However, to thwart off that risk, mercaptans are added into gas, which gives it a rotten egg smell and makes it detectable when leaking. Make sure to just trust an utmost professional with your gas line repair in Richmond.</p>
