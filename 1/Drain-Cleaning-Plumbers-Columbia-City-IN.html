<p>As the water treatment market has grown in the U.S., the idea of water softening has actually often been misconstrued as a purifying, cleansing or conditioning process.

<p>After professional drain cleaning, there are a few things you can do to keep your drains clear. Prevent putting grease or oil down the drains. Use an option of baking soda and vinegar occasionally to keep your drains and garbage disposal clean. You can utilize a natural drain cleaner regular monthly to keep your drains clear.

Location a container beneath the area to capture water then unscrew the 2 threaded caps that hold the curved section of the pipe in location. Nowadays, most kitchen drains are made of white PVC pipe with connections that can be unscrewed by hand.</p>
