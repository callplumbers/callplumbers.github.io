<p>Sewer linings can assist to repair cracked pipes without needing to entirely replace your sewer lines or ruin the area around them. Daily use should not cause a water softener to leak. Leaks can likewise occur if you run into the softener and jostle it, pulling the fitting apart. To avoid this from happening, install the unit in a steady and safe place. If you reside in an earthquake-prone area of the nation, secure the softener so that if the structure starts moving, the softener does not tip over and rip out the plumbing. If your water softener is leaking during regrowth, you must wait until after the cycle is finished and then inspected the system for cracks or broken fittings.
