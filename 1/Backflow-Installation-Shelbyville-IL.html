<p>Backflow is the unwanted reversal of circulation of water which may carry dirty water or other, hazardous compounds into the public water supply and private plumbing. Backflow can take place in a variety of circumstances that might draw water from places such as garden water fountains, swimming pools, or sprinkler system systems into City water system lines. Backflow can also carry water into your plumbing if it is linked to any outside water source. One example would be a garden hose connected to an external faucet with the end left in a mud puddle in a garden area.</p>
