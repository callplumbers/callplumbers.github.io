<p>Once the hardware parts have been cleaned up and checked and the rubber parts have actually been replaced, now reassemble the parts back into their components. Some elements may have very tight tolerances that have to be maintained. An essential thing to identify on each element is the guide. The guide is the part that steadies the motion or directs of the component. The guide is an extremely critical part of the style of each component. If the part is not repaired correctly, the guide could limit the motion (rather than consistent or direct) of the part, which could cause the part to not work to its capabilities. Sometimes springs are incorrectly blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. In most cases the guides are restricting the travel of the element triggering lower test outcomes than what is needed.</p>

At this point, the water softener will need to be worked on an alternate cycle called regrowth. Throughout this cycle, resin is backwashed with a salt solution. The salt water is reverse flushed through the system taking with it the calcium and magnesium ions that had been adsorbed on the resin. The softener can be returned to use once backwashing is total. Some water softeners will automatically switch to the operation cycle. Others have a manual switch. Figure 1 highlights both cycles of the water softening process-ion exchange and regeneration.</p>
