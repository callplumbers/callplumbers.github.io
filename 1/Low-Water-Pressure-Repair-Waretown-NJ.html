It's important to understand that RPZ assemblies, while more reliable, experience much greater pressure and volume loss than double-check assemblies. Fluctuations in line pressure, upstream or downstream, will trigger an appropriately functioning RPZ assembly to occasionally discharge small amounts of water. During a backflow condition, a large volume of water will flow from the relief valve. For this factor, RPZ assemblies should not be set up in locations based on water damage. Sufficient drainage needs to also be supplied.</p>
