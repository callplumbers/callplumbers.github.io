The pipe is generally 1/2 to 1-inch in size. Often, it enters the home near the hot water heater. Your main shut off is connected to the end of the water main. Make sure you check both ends of the pipe. We have discovered cases where the copper pipe goes into the house and polybutylene is at the meter.</p>
