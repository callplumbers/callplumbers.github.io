<p>Keep in mind: Hard water stops your washing cleaning agent from working effectively due to the fact that hard water ions can bond with detergent molecules to deactivate them. You, therefore, have to use increasingly more detergent to achieve the exact same cleaning power. The media gets a bath in the salt option. Difficult minerals caught in the resin (or zeolite) are launched and the media gets renewed with sodium ions. The water softener is likewise cleaned and disinfected during regrowth. Lastly, water containing the tough minerals and other waste gets eliminated of the system.</p>
