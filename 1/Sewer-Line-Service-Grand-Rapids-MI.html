Utilize a solution of baking soda and vinegar occasionally to keep your drains and garbage disposal clean. You can use an organic drain cleaner month-to-month to keep your drains clear. We advise organic items, such as Bio-Clean, since they work much better than products containing harsh chemicals and will not cause damage to your drains or fixtures.</p>
<p>In addition to water softening systems, Rinckey stated that reverse osmosis systems (ROs) are rather popular with homeowners in the area. He kept in mind that there are specific contaminants that locals are dealing with and an RO can help ease those issues. Due to being mostly agricultural in Montcalm and Ionia counties, some homeowners are setting up ROs to rid their water source of nitrates that are a product of farming waste. Rinckey noted that these systems eliminate around 94 percent of nitrates. Arsenic also naturally happens in some soils which too can be corrected with the best RO system.</p>
