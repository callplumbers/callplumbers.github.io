<p>Your kitchen sink is an essential part of your home, which makes its plumbing's efficient operating a necessity more than a need. As soon as the test results reveal the repair is complete, it is time to re-pressurize the plumbing system that was isolated throughout the repair process. It is essential that the plumbing system be switched on extremely slowly to assure no damage is done to the piping system. When the system is pressurized, air needs to be removed from the plumbing system. Each outlet on the plumbing system should be inspected to make sure no valves were accidentally left open or did not close correctly when re-pressurized. When the plumbing system is pressurized, make certain all valves are entirely open and alert the water user that the plumbing system has actually been gone back to service.</p>
