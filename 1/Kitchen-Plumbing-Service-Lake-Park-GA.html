<p>As the water treatment market has grown in the U.S., the idea of water softening has actually typically been misunderstood as a purifying, cleansing or conditioning process. This is due mostly to overstated marketing and, in part, to customer mistaken beliefs about water treatment. But the truth is that water softening simply removes hardness minerals and eliminates problems that are a problem and not a risk to human health. The choice "to soften or not to soften" refers individual preference not necessity. However, water softening does have benefits, and disadvantages, that make this choice a considerable one.</p>
<p>6. Install the new sink flange, gasket and rings. All sinks (and toilets) have drain traps, called P-traps, that keep sewer gas from entering your home. Plumbers can replace or fix blocked or leaking P-traps to keep them working appropriately. Leaking pipes can impact your indoor air quality.
