It is important that the repair professional understands the proper installation orientation and can evaluate the installation conditions to make sure there are no conditions preventing the working of the assembly. The backflow prevention assembly must be set up in the installation orientation for which it was approved. The majority of backflow preventers are set up in a horizontal orientation to the surrounding grade. Some (not all) backflow preventers can be installed in a vertical orientation, however it is important that the assembly just be installed if it is approved for that orientation.

<p>Wet pipe systems are installed in areas where the ambient temperature level is preserved at or above 40 ° F.

The addition of this chemical additive will require the installation of a high risk security assembly.</p>
