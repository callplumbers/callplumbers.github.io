You can try to fix the clog yourself by utilizing a plunger, which you can purchase your local hardware store. The only purpose of salt in a water softener is to regenerate the resin beads that take the solidity out of water.</p>
<p>Sooner or later, however, the beads reach maximum capacity and can't attract any more mineral ions. At that point, the softener tank need to be restored, or, flushed clean. That's where the salt water tank comes in. An on-board computer computes the amount of water that streams through the softener. When it reaches the preprogrammed setting, regrowth automatically starts. For a three-bedroom home and household of four, regrowth generally occurs every 12,000 gallons.</p>
