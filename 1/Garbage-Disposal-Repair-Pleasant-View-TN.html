<p>The very best source for this type of plumber is a basic contractor. The contractor sees the plumber's work before it's covered; you don't get that opportunity. In addition, your contractor understands the indications of quality work that you may miss out on, like clean solder joints, crisp 90-degree angles at joints and clean, correctly sized holes in joists, studs, and floors. Finally, a quality contractor will not threat dealing with an inferior plumber.
