<p>Aside from these 2 important components, there are a myriad of small, maybe less important things that can break or degrade. For instance, if you lose your toilet bowl bolt covers (those little caps on the base of the toilet), the bolts holding your toilet to the floor will rust much more quickly. Consistent gross smells coming from the toilet can show you need a brand-new wax ring where your toilet connects to the floor drain. You might need a new cap for the fill valve if the float rod of your fill valve isn't raising appropriately. Bulges in the supply line can burst and trigger a leak. If mishandled, tank covers can split and leave your toilet's inner functions exposed. While this will not affect the function of your toilet, it definitely does not do much for the visual of your bathroom. We're not attempting to psych you out by pointing out all the important things that can fail, the point is - your toilet is a total fixture and every part needs to be in good shape for it to function at its best.</p>

<p>It assists to know the brand name and design of your toilet. The trademark name is normally on the bowl behind the seat.
