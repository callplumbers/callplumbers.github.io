Trenchless pipe repair is a form of pipe repair that does not involve any excavation.

The pipe lining procedure involves our team saturating a felt liner with an unique resin mix. When the felt liner is entirely saturated, it is pushed through your pipeline. As the liner moves through your pipes, it coats the interior walls, sealing all fractures and imperfections. If heat is used, the liner is left to harden in location for several hours or 60 minutes. As soon as the process is complete, the liner will be eliminated and your pipe will be examined one more time to ensure your new pipe is set within your existing one.</p>
