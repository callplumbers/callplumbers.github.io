<p>Each component of the assembly must be evaluated to identify what needs repair. The field test may not always show you the seriousness of the failure or whether repair parts beyond the fundamental rubber repair kit are needed. There may be extra test procedures, beyond those established in the tester accreditation program, that can offer information showing the intensity of the failure that might assist in the diagnostic analysis of the backflow prevention assembly.</p>

<p>The correct repair of a backflow preventer needs lots of products to be assessed. The hydraulic conditions present at the backflow prevention assembly need to be examined. The installation should be examined to guarantee it does not prevent the operations of the assembly. Test information need to be built up to identify the operations of each part. The backflow prevention assembly should be disassembled and parts changed with initial factory parts. The backflow prevention assembly must be checked again to be sure it was appropriately fixed. Comparing the test results from the fixed backflow prevention assembly to the producers flowchart is needed to guarantee it was repaired correctly. A properly fixed assembly should offer years of security.</p>
