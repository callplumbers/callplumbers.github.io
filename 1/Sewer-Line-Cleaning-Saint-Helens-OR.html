Step the height of your old water heater and purchase a new one the exact same height so you don't need to change the length of the water, gas or electrical lines.</p>
<p>A cross-connection is any temporary or permanent connection between a public water system or consumer's safe and clean (i.e., drinking) water supply and any source or system including nonpotable water or other substances. An example is the piping between a public water supply or customer's potable water supply and an auxiliary water supply, cooling system or irrigation system.</p>
<p>Your garbage disposal makes sure that your sink and plumbing fixtures don't get clogged. Contrary to some people's perception, garbage disposals do not contain blades. Rather, a waste disposal unit includes two fixed bolts that are repaired to a spinning disk. When the disposal is turned on the disks rapidly spin, and these bolts force food and particles to grind versus a stationary mill along the periphery of the spinning disk. This high-speed action successfully pulverizes the food waste in the disposal so that it can travel down the drain without obstructing.</p>
