<p>The U-shaped pipe below kitchen and bathroom sinks is something that people expect to see but seldom stop to think of. The flywheel is jammed: If the disposal hums when you turn the switch, however it doesn't grind up food, this indicates the flywheel is stuck. Try releasing the jam by inserting a hex wrench of the proper size into the hole on the bottom of the garbage disposal. At the same time, you can prod the flywheel by sticking a broom deal with (not your fingers!) into the sink.</p>

<h3>Helpful Tips For Selecting A Reputable, Budget Friendly Plumber Hempstead TX</h3>
