<p>Set up 50 gallon electrical hot water heater and thermal expansion tank. When your drains are clogged, you will most likely start to notice gurgling sounds, water supporting into your sink or shower, or strange smells. Drain obstructions are brought on by wear and tear or a build-up of things we put down the drain over time and as we understand, they can trigger serious plumbing problems.</p>
<p>Kitchen sinks are constantly vulnerable to blockages with food and grease being the significant perpetrators. If fats are poured down the sink, they congeal to the piping walls. Food follows the grease down the plumbing, connecting to the walls too. Even tree roots can create major drain blockages by wrapping around pipes. Their crushing strength stops the water flow, requiring plumbers to find and repair the issue for typical home plumbing operations. You need your drain cleaned before it leads to more damage and even more expensive repairs if this is what is occurring to your house.</p>
