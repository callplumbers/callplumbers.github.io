<p>When a flush valve causes a toilet to run, a worn flapper is typically the offender. However not always. Initially, look at the chain that raises the flapper. If there's excessive slack in the chain, it can tangle up and prevent the flapper from closing securely. A chain with insufficient slack can trigger trouble too. Picture 3 demonstrates how to set the slack perfect.</p>
<p>Toilet flush handles are another part of a toilet that can cause toilets to keep running. Typically manages are toilet parts that get corroded or loose and no longer pull the flap up or drop it back down correctly. It's a simple repair, however there's a technique to getting the flush manage out. The retaining nut inside the tank is a reverse thread. So, if you're in front of the toilet, turn the nut to the delegated loosen (Photo 1).

This high-speed action successfully pulverizes the food waste in the disposal so that it can take a trip down the drain without blocking.</p>
