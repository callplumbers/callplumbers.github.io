<h3>The Benefits of Using Professional Drainage Services in Flagler Beach FL 32136</h3>
<p>Water temperature problems can be fixed by changing the temperature level on the water heater. Low water pressure from a sink faucet might be caused by a blocked aerator screen. Homeowners can merely unscrew the aerator screen from the faucet to clear out minerals or other deposits. Water pressure can also be low if the shutoff valves under the sink are not open all the way.</p>
<p>When a flush valve triggers a toilet to run, a used flapper is generally the offender. But not always. First, take a look at the chain that raises the flapper. If there's excessive slack in the chain, it can tangle up and avoid the flapper from closing firmly. A chain with insufficient slack can cause difficulty too. Photo 3 shows how to set the slack just right.</p>
<p>The average toilet will last for years and have minimal problems that can be quickly fixed without replacement. Nevertheless, when it is time for toilet replacement, it is necessary to have a skilled and licensed  plumber deal with the job. At Morrison Plumbing, Heating and Air, we have over thirty years of experience with toilet installation and toilet replacement. Whether you need a new toilet for a bathroom remodel, moving into a brand-new house, or just wanting to upgrade your present toilet, we ensure that our installation process won't damage your home or its plumbing system.</p>
