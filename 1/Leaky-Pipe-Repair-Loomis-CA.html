Nevertheless, there's still some research you can do before we arrive to help speed up the procedure.</p>
<p>Idea: Contact local codes before trying to install a garbage disposal. Some communities have plumbing codes that don't allow disposals due to the fact that of limits on sewer capability.

A backflow preventer not only secures drinking water in private residences, it also avoids wastewater in private homes from flowing back out and polluting the public supply of water.</p>
