If your water softener is leaking during regeneration, you need to wait until after the cycle is completed and after that checked the system for cracks or broken fittings. You need to also examine to make sure your drain line is never ever blocked up with particles. A clogged drain line can blow off of the softener during regrowth and flood your basement or garage.</p>
