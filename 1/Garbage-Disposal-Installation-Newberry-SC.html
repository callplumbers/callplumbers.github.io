Foods like rice and pasta can swell when mixed with water, and possibly trigger a clog. Fruit and vegetable peels can likewise cause obstructions and jams - think about composting or placing these products in the garbage. In addition, grease and oil can gather and congeal in your drain also. After finishing cooking, think about pouring leftover grease or oil into a jar or bowl to reserve. You can then use and reheat for other cooking or easily place in the garbage after it's hardened.</p>

Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the potable supply of water pressure) can arise from an increase in downstream pressure, a reduction in the safe and clean water supply pressure, or a mix of both. Increases in downstream pressure can be produced by pumps, temperature level increases in boilers, etc. Reductions in potable supply of water pressure take place whenever the quantity of water being utilized surpasses the amount of water being supplied, such as during water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
