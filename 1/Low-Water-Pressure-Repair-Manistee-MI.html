<p>The Plumbing Inspections group is consisted of 6 State of Ohio-certified plumbing inspectors, among which is also functions as the Supervising Inspector and the Plumbing Plan Inspector for the group. Toilets save lives. It may sound crazy, but it's true. Correct sanitation in the type of functioning toilets and properly maintained sewage systems helps avoid potentially dangerous illness from assaulting you and your household. In the United States we are extremely fortunate that the majority of us never have to fret about capturing such illnesses, however it is still essential to keep our toilets clean and in good operating condition to avoid the potential for disease to our families - in addition to conserving ourselves the basic hassle and high cost of toilet problems left ignored for too long. Luckily, many toilet problems are relatively easy to fix yourself, and your friends at ® are here to assist arm you with the information and tools you need to manage nearly any toilet crisis quickly and quickly.</p>
<p>The individual who does the testing should be a certified backflow tester. Not all licensed plumbers have this accreditation, and a plumbing license is not required to get this accreditation. I have actually talked to a few plumbers, and the estimate for backflow testing varied from $150 - $250, however I would anticipate the price to be significantly less from backflow testers who are not licensed plumbers.</p>

<p>The list of things a food disposer can consume is relatively short. Soft or crisp foods are great, but difficult or stringy foods can be difficulty. Disposers can be stopped in their tracks by celery, eggshells and apple seeds, as well as the normal kitchen flotsam, consisting of pop-tabs, searching pads and twist-ties. While some older houses may not have backflow preventers, all newer homes are required to have them. If you're not exactly sure what type of backflow preventers are used in your house or company, Doug's can help you find and determine them. We can also perform your annual backflow inspections.</p>
