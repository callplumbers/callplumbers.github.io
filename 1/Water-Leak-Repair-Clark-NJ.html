<h3>Water Heater Repair: When to Do It Yourself, and When to Call the Pros in Clark NJ 07066</h3>
<p>Backflow indicates the undesirable reversal of flow of a liquid, gas, or suspended strong into the drinkable supply of water; a backflow preventer is developed to keep this from occurring. Points at which a potable water system gets in touch with a non-potable water supply are called cross connections. Such connections take place naturally in appliances such as clothing washers and dishwashing machines, but they must be thoroughly designed and set up to prevent backflow. Another typical area for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water main, to avoid pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the public water system.</p>
