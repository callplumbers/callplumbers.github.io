<p>Backpressure backflow is triggered by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or customer's potable water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the drinkable water supply pressure) can arise from an increase in downstream pressure, a reduction in the safe and clean water supply pressure, or a mix of both. Boosts in downstream pressure can be developed by pumps, temperature level boosts in boilers, and so on.

<p>Another common argument against the need for backflow preventers is that if all the valves are closed the water can't go backwards through them, so the valves need to avoid backflow.  The apparent problem with this is that if the backflow takes place at a time when the valve is open, like when the sprinklers are on, the valve will not stop backflow!  What if the valve is closed?  A standard by hand run valve needs to stop backflow when it is closed - if the valve if fully closed, has excellent seals, and does not leak.  However most of the automated valves, such as the electrical solenoid valves used for watering systems, will not stop backflow even when off" and fully closed.</p>
