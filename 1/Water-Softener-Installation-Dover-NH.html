<p>The mineral tank is the chamber where the hard water is softened. The water supply line feeds the hard water into the tank. The water leaks through the bed of resin beads, transferring the water-hardening calcium and magnesium ions. The water exits the tank soft and flows through your pipes and out to your household home appliances. Backflow is a term used in the plumbing world to explain an undesirable flow of water in the reverse direction. The backflow of water carries impurities back to the primary water system system, making the water in it hazardous to drink.</p>
