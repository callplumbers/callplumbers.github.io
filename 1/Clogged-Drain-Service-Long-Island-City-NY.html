The backflow prevention assembly must be disassembled and parts changed with initial factory parts. The backflow prevention assembly need to be tested once again to be sure it was appropriately fixed. Comparing the test results from the repaired backflow prevention assembly to the producers flow chart is needed to guarantee it was fixed correctly. A properly fixed assembly needs to provide years of defense.</p>
