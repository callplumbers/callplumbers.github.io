<p>Lots of property owners will use a store-bought chemical drain cleaner to solve their unclean or clogged drain issues. These chemicals are easy to use and inexpensive, but they harm your pipes and their effects are only short term. Store-bought liquid drain cleaners utilize harsh chemicals to gnaw at the clog and with duplicated usage, these chemicals will also eat away at the pipe producing weak spots that are susceptible to burst. This is why professional drain cleaning from a drain cleaning company is always recommended.</p>
<p>A variety of companies, such as the American Water Functions Association (AWWA) and the American Backflow Prevention Association (ABPA) use accreditation courses created to train experts to check backflow preventers. Requirements for training vary by jurisdiction. Inspection of backflow preventers requires understanding of installation requirements, although inspectors are not required to end up being certified.</p>
