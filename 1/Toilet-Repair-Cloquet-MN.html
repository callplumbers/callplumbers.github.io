<p>The Mesopotamians introduced the world to clay sewer pipes around 4000 BCE, with the earliest examples found in the Temple of Bel at Nippur and at Eshnunna, 7 used to get rid of wastewater from sites, and capture rainwater, in wells. The city or Uruk includes the oldest known examples of brick built Latrines, constructed atop interconnecting fired clay sewer pipes, c. 3200 BCE. 8 9 Clay pipes were later utilized in the Hittite city of Hattusa 10 They had exchangeable and quickly removable sectors, and enabled cleaning.</p>
<p>The pipe-bursting approach is utilized on pipes that are badly harmed, for changing an entire pipe system, or for fixing bigger sections of sewer pipeline The installers need physical access to the pipe in order to begin repair, which includes two four foot square access pits at either end of the pipeline. The installers begin by placing a "bursting head" at the access point on one end of the pipe. Hydraulic power is utilized to drag the head through the pipe. As it makes its method through the system, breaking the old pipe apart and drawing in a brand-new smooth pipe behind it. The pipe is a plastic product that will be impervious to root invasion for approximately 100 years.</p>
