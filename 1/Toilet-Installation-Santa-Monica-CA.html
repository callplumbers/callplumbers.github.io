<h3>Prices For Unclogging And Video Inspection Santa Monica CA</h3>
<p>The most reliable way to address hard water is with a water softener. When calcium and magnesium-- the firmness ions-- are gathered by tiny resin beads through a process called ion exchange, water is softened. The resin beads are charged with sodium or potassium ions. When hard water comes in contact with the resin beads, the calcium and magnesium are pulled out of the water and changed with salt or potassium, leaving your water soft.</p>
<p>The most typical method for producing soft water is through ion exchange, a procedure in which the calcium and magnesium in the water are exchanged for another component, generally salt. Salt won't trigger lime scale or soap residue buildup like other minerals do, and water softening adds just an extremely small amount of sodium to your water. According to the Mayo Center, an 8-ounce glass of soft water would have less than 12.5 milligrams of salt, which is considered extremely low salt" by the Food and Drug Administration.</p>
