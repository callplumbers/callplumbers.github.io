<p>Backflow means the unwanted reversal of circulation of a liquid, gas, or suspended strong into the drinkable water supply; a backflow preventer is created to keep this from occurring. Points at which a safe and clean water system connects with a non-potable water supply are called cross connections. Such connections occur naturally in devices such as clothing washers and dishwashers, however they need to be thoroughly designed and installed to avoid backflow. Another common location for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water pipe, to avoid pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the general public water supply.</p>
<p>Backflow is the unfavorable turnaround of circulation in a drinkable water distribution system. Water that is constantly under pressure can just flow in one instructions.

Likewise, hybrids need up to 1,000 cubic feet of uncooled space to catch enough heat from the air, and a drain in close proximity to release the condensate.</p>
