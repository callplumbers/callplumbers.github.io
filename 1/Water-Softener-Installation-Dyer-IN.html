<h3>How To Repair Your Water Heater in Dyer IN 46311</h3>
<p>Backflow indicates the undesirable reversal of flow of a liquid, gas, or suspended strong into the potable water system; a backflow preventer is designed to keep this from taking place. Points at which a potable water system connects with a non-potable water system are called cross connections. Such connections take place naturally in home appliances such as clothing washers and dishwashers, however they must be thoroughly designed and set up to prevent backflow. Another common area for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water main, to prevent pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the general public supply of water.</p>
<p>This is an elbow-shaped device bent at a 90 degree angle. There is a valve on the inside of it that avoids water backflow. The system is based upon pressure and must be set up a minimum of six inches of where the downstream will be. It can be placed on PVC pipes, but is not testable.
