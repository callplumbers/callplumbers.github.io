<p>Waste Disposal Unit Installation Sick Of False Assures? Water circulates in the tank where small resin beads switch the calcium and magnesium in the water for the sodium or potassium they're holding. The beads act as a sponge, adsorbing the firmness minerals from your water. This process is referred to as ion exchange, and soft water is the outcome. When the resin beads have actually maxed out their ability to hold calcium and magnesium, it's time for them to be recharged (a process called regrowth). Throughout this procedure, the resin beads are cleaned with the extremely concentrated saltwater solution (brine) from the tank (made from the salt you added to the tank). The brine requires the calcium and magnesium ions to be released from the beads and changed with salt or potassium ions.</p>

<p>In some cases, an inexperienced person will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the assumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair might be as basic as changing a couple of rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or might need the replacement of a few of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester carries out a field test, he produces data on the operations of the assembly.  It ends up being the tester's duty to understand what the field test data implies for that particular assembly.  When a trained tester interprets the information, he can determine what parts of the backflow prevention assembly failed the test and needs repair.</p>
