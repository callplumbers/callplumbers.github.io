<p>Backflow indicates the unwanted reversal of flow of a liquid, gas, or suspended solid into the potable supply of water; a backflow preventer is developed to keep this from taking place. Points at which a drinkable water system connects with a non-potable water system are called cross connections. Such connections take place naturally in devices such as clothing washers and dishwashers, but they need to be thoroughly developed and set up to avoid backflow. Another common place for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water main, to prevent pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the public water supply.</p>
