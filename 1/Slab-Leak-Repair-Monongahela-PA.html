<p>A partial reroute is generally a little scale repiping of one or more afflicted areas of the plumbing underneath the slab. In cases where jackhammering and fixing the pipe are not cost effective, it is possible to only abandon the affected area of pipe and reroute the line through the attics, ceilings and walls. Costing less than a complete repipe, completion result is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that may leak again in the future. We have experienced houses having 2 or more slab leaks within a 1-2 year period, and these repairs can accumulate in cost very rapidly. This is the main reason why we will recommend a complete repipe in certain areas, based on our experience.</p>
