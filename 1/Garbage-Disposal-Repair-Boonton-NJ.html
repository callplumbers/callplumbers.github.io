Section 312.10 of the Ohio Plumbing Code covers the installation, repairs and testing of seclusion backflow preventers (BFP) and Section 608 of the Ohio Plumbing Code addresses protection of the potable water supply within a structure these gadgets are referred to as seclusion" BFP. Once again, the very best type of backflow prevention is an air space, such as the outlet of a faucet and where water would stream over the rim of a sink or bathtub. The Warren County Plumbing Department checks to ensure there is an air gap, if there is no chance to provide one, then we examine to see that the proper BFP device is set up. These BFP's, if testable, are needed to be evaluated (by a certified backflow preventer tester) upon installation and at least every twelve months thereafter.</p>

A plumber will place a specifically developed water resistant camera through your sewer line and capture live footage to determine where and what the source of the issue is.</p>
