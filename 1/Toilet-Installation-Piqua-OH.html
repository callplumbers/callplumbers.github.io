Each outlet on the plumbing system must be checked to guarantee no valves were mistakenly exposed or did not close effectively when re-pressurized. Once the plumbing system is pressurized, make sure all valves are entirely open and inform the water user that the plumbing system has actually been returned to service.</p>
