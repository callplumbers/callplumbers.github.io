Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the safe and clean water system pressure) can result from a boost in downstream pressure, a decrease in the potable water system pressure, or a combination of both. Pumps can develop boosts in downstream pressure; temperature boosts in boilers, etc. Reductions in safe and clean water system pressure happen whenever the amount of water being utilized goes beyond the amount of water being supplied, such as during water line flushing, fire combating, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
