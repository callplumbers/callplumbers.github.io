<p>Damage control is an issue. As a sewer and drain cleaning company, I encounter scenarios, frequently that require a company such as Serve Pro to precede me on the task. Sometimes, the basements are so filled with sewage, I can not safely go into the basement and run until the sewage is extracted and the basement is typically cleaned up. I 'd love to publish some photos of this. Simply look on line. The issue does exist.</p>
