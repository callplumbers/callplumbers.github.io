<h3>Tips For Finding An Emergency Plumber New Windsor NY</h3>
<p>These people were amazing! They appeared early and remained late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has actually been an issue on and off for years now. It was installed 7 years ago, and it never ever drained this well. I picked this company due to the fact that they had great reviews and a fair rate, and even though the task took a lot more time and work than they expected it to, they honored their quote. I will utilize Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing needs in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were monsters. They had a huge, disgusting mess on their hands (literally), and they did a terrific job tidying up after it too.</p>
