Adequate drainage must also be offered.</p>

<p>If your assembly stops working the yearly test, you are accountable for repairing or replacing the assembly within thirty days. All replacements need to be installed to Manatee County Utilities Standards and be the correct type of assembly based upon the conditions on your residential or commercial property (see section below "Needed Backflow Prevention Assemblies") Furthermore, the assembly should fulfill the lead free requirement of Section 1417 of the Safe Drinking Water Act (42 U.S.C. 300g-6) If you are still out of compliance after the 30 days, all water services will be ceased up until the assembly is in compliance.</p>
<p>Letters are sent out to residential clients with recognized backflow gadgets on an annual basis. The City's plumbing code requires a backflow preventer on all landscape watering systems, swimming pools, and hot tubs. Turn the disposal unit to line up the discharge tailpiece with the drain trap, and after that connect it. Relying on the existing trap configuration, you may need to replace some or all of the drain piping underneath the sink to accommodate the disposal.</p>
