<p>Viking SupplyNet's comprehensive stock of backflow valves and associated gadgets includes leading items from Wilkins, Ames, Watts, and others. Oxidants such as chlorine in the public water supply respond with the polybutylene piping and acetal fittings, causing them to scale, flake, and become fragile. This leads to micro-fractures and minimizes the fundamental structural integrity of the system. The system becomes weak and may fail without warning, triggering damage to the building structure and personal effects. Inappropriate installation is also a common cause of polybutylene system failure, which can be almost difficult to find.</p>
<p>Throughout sewer camera inspection, a Bob Oates service technician inserts a high-resolution camera with a light connected to it into the sewer line at your property. The camera is by hand controlled on a versatile rod, or driven through the pipes on a tractor. The high-resolution light supplies a clear image for the service technician to accurately examine conditions and identify the functionality of the pipes. The information we glean from the inspection enables us to make an informed choice relating to the condition of your pipes and suggest the best option as well. If the pipe needs to be cleaned of blockages or relined with epoxy resin, we can make the ideal recommendation with self-confidence.</p>
