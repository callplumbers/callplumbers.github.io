<p>Backpressure backflow is caused by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or customer's drinkable water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the drinkable water system pressure) can result from an increase in downstream pressure, a decrease in the potable water supply pressure, or a mix of both. Boosts in downstream pressure can be produced by pumps, temperature level increases in boilers, and so on. Decreases in drinkable supply of water pressure take place whenever the amount of water being utilized goes beyond the quantity of water being supplied, such as during water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>
