Do not switch on or off any electrical switches, devices, or lights, as an electrical charge might create a spark. When you remain in a safe location, call the Peoples emergency hotline.</p>

<p>Downsides to be aware of is that hybrid hot water heater need to be set up in an area that remains between 40 to 90 degrees, or they will not work well. They need approximately 7 feet of clearance from the floor to ceiling, since the heatpump is on top of the hot water heater. Likewise, hybrids need approximately 1,000 cubic feet of uncooled space to record adequate heat from the air, and a drain in close distance to release the condensate.</p>
