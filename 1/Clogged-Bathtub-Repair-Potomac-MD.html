Typically, they start little and go unnoticed, and after time can lead to big puddles beneath your sink and kitchen cabinetry. This type results in possible water damage. A lot of other types of leaky kitchen sinks which are annoying but are normally repaired easily. Connection concerns between the faucet and water supply line or sprayer hose, and missing gaskets in between the faucet and sink are huge culprits. Worse might be corrosion in the pipes that should be replaced.</p>
<p>If you hear water running in your toilet and you suspect a leaky toilet tank or toilet bowl, attempt this: spray a couple of drops of food coloring to the toilet tank and let the toilet sit for about half an hour. After 30 minutes, examine to see if any of the water in your toilet bowl has actually altered color. If it has, you most likely have a leak.</p>
