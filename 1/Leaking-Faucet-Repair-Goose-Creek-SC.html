As hard water goes through the mineral tank, the beads inside bring in the positively-charged calcium and magnesium ions. The minerals that cause hard water stay with the beads, and the treated water goes out into your home's plumbing system.</p>

We offer a range of options for houses and businesses that remove undesirable minerals and increase the efficiency of water related appliances.
