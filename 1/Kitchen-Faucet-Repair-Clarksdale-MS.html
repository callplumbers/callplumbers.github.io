<p>Water temperature issues can be fixed by changing the temperature on the hot water heater. Low water pressure from a sink faucet might be brought on by a blocked aerator screen. Homeowners can simply loosen the aerator screen from the faucet to clear out minerals or other deposits. Water pressure can also be low if the shutoff valves under the sink are not open all the way.</p>
<p>Water softening shower heads can provide the exact same advantages as a water softening system. You'll be able to remove soap and shampoo without leaving any residue, leaving you with much healthier hair and smoother skin. There are lots of water softening shower heads offered, so you can easily find one that will suit your existing shower.</p>
<p>Sooner or later, however, the beads reach optimal capability and can't bring in any more mineral ions. At that point, the softener tank should be restored, or, flushed clean. That's where the salt water tank is available in. An on-board computer computes the amount of water that flows through the softener. Regeneration automatically starts when it reaches the preprogrammed setting. For a three-bedroom home and household of four, regeneration typically happens every 12,000 gallons.</p>
