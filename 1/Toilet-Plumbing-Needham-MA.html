<p>Aside from these two crucial components, there are a myriad of small, maybe less critical things that can degrade or break. For instance, if you lose your toilet bowl bolt covers (those little caps on the base of the toilet), the bolts holding your toilet to the floor will rust far more quickly. Constant gross smells originating from the toilet can suggest you need a brand-new wax ring where your toilet attaches to the floor drain. You might need a brand-new cap for the fill valve if the float rod of your fill valve isn't lifting properly. Bulges in the supply line can trigger a leak and burst. Tank lids can crack and leave your toilet's inner functions exposed if mishandled. While this won't affect the function of your toilet, it definitely does not do much for the visual of your bathroom.
