<p>In water distribution systems, water is usually kept at a substantial pressure to allow water to flow from the tap, shower, or other component. Water pressure might be or stop working lowered when a water pipe bursts, pipes freeze, or there is all of a sudden high need on the water system (for example, when numerous fire hydrants are opened). Lowered pressure in the pipe may allow polluted water from the soil, from storage, or from other sources to be drawn up into the system.</p>
<p>Was your house constructed prior to the 1970s and has not gone through remodeling or pipe replacement? It is most likely that your pipes are made of galvanized metal or another product which has actually corroded and decayed over the years if so.
