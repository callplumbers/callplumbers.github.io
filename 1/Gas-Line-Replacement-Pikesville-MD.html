<p>Backflow is bad news. The severe water conditions in Orlando and Central Florida are tough on water pipes. Over an amount of time the inside lining of the pipe will weaken and a small pinhole leak will establish. Sometimes the service is to repair the broken area of pipe, and an area repair is all that is required to resolve the issue. Other times a more comprehensive option is required: repiping.</p>
<p>Presented more than a decade ago, Uponor ProPEX fittings stay the best technique for making leak-proof Uponor PEX-a connections fast and easy. Capitalizing on the special, thermal shape memory of Uponor's PEX-a tubing, fittings in fact get more powerful gradually. No need to worry about behind-the-wall connections - ProPEX joints will last the life of the building.</p>

<p>Your home's drainage works by the simple force of gravity. When you flush water and squander down your sink or shower (and your toilets as well) it's not truly the circulation of water pressing them down your pipes. Instead, once they go down your drain, gravity takes over as the pipes under the ground are pitched at a downward angle to the sewer line. Anything you pour down there won't go through when something blocks the pipes.</p>
