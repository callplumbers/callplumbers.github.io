<p>Do not put everything down your waste disposal unit. It is necessary to view what you put down your waste disposal unit. Foods like rice and pasta can swell when mixed with water, and potentially trigger a clog. Vegetables and fruit peels can likewise trigger clogs and jams - think about composting or positioning these items in the garbage.

<p>Your old discharge tube probably will not be the ideal length for your brand-new disposal. If it's too long, simply connect it to the disposal, mark it and suffice with a hacksaw for your garbage disposal installation. (Loosen the other pipe connections, if required, to place the tube back into the tee.) If the old discharge tube is too short, you may have to make a time-wasting journey to the store. To avoid this, make sure the new garbage disposal installation package includes a tube, or purchase one independently at the same time for about $3.</p>
<p>The kinds of backflow preventers the company offers include double check valve assemblies, check detector assemblies (including stainless-steel designs), and reduced pressure zone assemblies. Tip: If the disposal has a line to the dishwasher, eliminate the plastic drain plug (or "knockout") from the disposal inlet before installing the disposal. When you connect the P-trap, also attach the dishwasher discharge tube to the inlet.</p>
