It is necessary to understand that RPZ assemblies, while more reliable, experience much greater pressure and volume loss than double-check assemblies.

During a backflow condition, a large volume of water will flow from the relief valve. For this reason, RPZ assemblies shouldn't be set up in locations subject to water damage. Appropriate drainage must also be supplied.</p>
<p>More recent designs, such as tankless hot water heater, are much more energy-efficient and can assist you minimize your month-to-month utility expenses. Property owners who get a supply of difficult water should get a water conditioner device like a water softener installed at their location.

<p>It can take a number of weeks for backflow preventer installation and compliance to be completed. First, plans for each device to be installed should be drawn up by a RA or PE, and an application for approval sent to the DEP, which may take up to 3 weeks or more to approve and process. Turned down plans should be modified and resubmitted to the DEP approval queue, which can add another a number of weeks to the timeline.</p>
<p>A. Normally wax doesn't "spoil" on a standard floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to avoid leakages. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet exists to prevent smells. If you are experiencing a leak originating from underneath the floor-mounted toilet, you most likely have a partial (or full blown) toilet blockage down the drain line (or the toilet is cracked in the bowl). Likewise, ensure the leak isn't coming from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "common" undetected issue. Attempt putting a few drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a couple of hours if you aren't sure where the leak is coming from.</p>
