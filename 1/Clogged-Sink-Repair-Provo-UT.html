Most of toilets are basic sized - indicating a "will fit" seat suffices for security and comfort. Some toilets, nevertheless, have uniquely shaped bowls and require a specific seat, like the Eljer Emblem. It actually isn't an excellent concept to utilize a toilet seat that is either much too big or much to little, unless they have actually been specifically created to fit typical toilets, as the toilet seat can wobble and cause you to slide around, or won't distribute your weight uniformly and could eventually trigger cracks in the bowl.</p>
