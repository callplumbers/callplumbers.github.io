<h3>Clearing Blocked Drains at Douglasville GA 30135</h3>
<p>106.2.3 Plumbing Maintenance. The clearing of blockages in fixture branches; the fixing of incidental leakages in components, valves or pipes; or the elimination and reinstallation of existing or brand-new plumbing fixtures, residential type plumbing devices, non-testable backflow devices, and plumbing appurtenances; provided that such repairs do not need the replacement or include of concealed piping, or the rearrangement of valves, pipes or fixtures.</p>
<p>A. Normally wax doesn't "spoil" on a standard floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to prevent leaks. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet exists to avoid smells. If you are experiencing a leak originating from beneath the floor-mounted toilet, you most likely have a partial (or full blown) toilet blockage down the drain line (or the toilet is split in the bowl). Also, make sure the leak isn't originating from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "normal" undetected issue. If you aren't sure where the leak is originating from, attempt putting a few drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a couple of hours.</p>
<p>Backflow prevention test kits and repair parts are a must for the avid do-it-yourselfer. Our backflow test sets work with all reduced pressure principle, check valve, spill resistant, and pressure vacuum breaker type backflow preventers. All our kits are portable and compact, and feature the necessary assesses, hose pipes, and adapter fittings.</p>
