In cases where jackhammering and fixing the pipe are not cost reliable, it is possible to just abandon the afflicted area of pipe and reroute the line through the ceilings, walls and attics. Costing less than a complete repipe, the end result is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that may leak once again in the future. We have experienced houses having 2 or more slab leakages within a 1-2 year duration, and these repairs can add up in cost very quickly.
