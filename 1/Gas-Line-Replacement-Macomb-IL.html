<h3>Well Systems and Well Pumps in Macomb Illinois</h2>
<p>Water softening makes use of a process called "ion exchange" to get rid of dissolved difficult water minerals such as calcium, manganese, iron and magnesium. These minerals can't be caught by a filter, so a molecular response is needed. Water softeners have resin beads that keep salt, and as the hard water streams through the resin, the sodium is switched for the tough water minerals. The difficult water minerals are trapped in a trace and the softener quantity of sodium flows out with the softened water.</p>
<p>Unanticipated changes in water pressure could possibly be due to corrosion and accumulation within the pipes themselves, which narrow the passage that water can move through. You'll most likely notice lower water pressure in the shower or when washing dishes. The best solution is to replace your plumbing with new pipes that don't have buildup.</p>
