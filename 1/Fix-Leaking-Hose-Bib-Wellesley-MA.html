<p>The use of different metals in the plumbing can result in galvanic deterioration Direct contact in between dissimilar metals will initiate the formation of a galvanic cell, which is created whenever two various types of metal are conductively connected to each other, and then immersed in an electrolyte such as water. Within the galvanic cell, the more anodic metal will be rusted and an electrical current is developed due to the fact that of the process. A typical example of this is when galvanized pipe is directly connected to copper pipe. It is also worth noting that while using a brass fitting to bridge the gap between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it likewise will not completely avoid it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be used to reduce this direct contact between the different metals. A dielectric coupling contains an insulating product that physically separates contact in between the 2 metals.</p>

<p>Gas is an essential energy we use every day to keep our offices and houses warm, our showers hot, and to prepare our food. With the everyday use of gas, it is easy to understand it is reasonable that in time a leak is bound to occur. When a leak appears, it is important to know the signs, signs, and how to act. Keep in mind to take preventative measures when dealing with gas appliances, utilize the aforementioned signs to identify potential leakages, and call a plumber to have your gas lines frequently kept and examined.</p>

Plumbing Codes and State law determine minimum standards for backflow prevention.

Within the City of Seattle only, anybody who installs gas piping on property not under their ownership should possess a Seattle Gas Piping Mechanic License. All gas piping installations require a license and inspection.</p>
