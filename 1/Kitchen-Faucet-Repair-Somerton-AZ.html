<p>Waste Disposal Unit Installation Fed Up With False Assures? Water flows in the tank where tiny resin beads swap the calcium and magnesium in the water for the sodium or potassium they're holding. The beads act as a sponge, adsorbing the firmness minerals from your water. This process is referred to as ion exchange, and soft water is the outcome. When the resin beads have actually maxed out their ability to hold calcium and magnesium, it's time for them to be recharged (a process called regrowth). Throughout this process, the resin beads are cleaned with the extremely concentrated saltwater option (brine) from the tank (made from the salt you contributed to the tank).
