Water in a gas pipe is probably from a leak, not from "condensation" as the water material of LP or natural gas is extremely low. Rainwater which has actually not infiltrated the earth is an exceptionally pure kind of water. When water vaporizes it leaves behind dissolved solids i.e. calcium and magnesium ions. For that reason when vaporized water eventually falls as rain - it is soft.</p>

The existence of high levels of carbon dioxide tends to associate with particular geologic conditions.</p>
