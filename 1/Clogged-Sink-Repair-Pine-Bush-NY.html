<p>Button Plumbing was excellent. If I shut off the water under the sink, they replaced my kitchen faucet and added two brand-new shut off valves under the sink which had always leaked in the previous. I pointed out that my bathroom sink was draining slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were really friendly and got the work done rapidly. The rate was quite reasonable. I will certainly use them for any future plumbing requirements. I was super happy with their service.</p>
