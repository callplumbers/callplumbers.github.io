<p>Nevertheless, there is one Do It Yourself job that isn't basic and is best left to the professionals: sewer line repair Sewer repairs can rapidly become complex when dealt with by someone with little to no experience in plumbing. While it may seem like a task worth handling, there are numerous reasons to avoid taking a DIY approach to a sewer line repair task and rather select to employ a licensed, professional plumber.</p>
<p>The source or place of a sewer issue determines who pays for repair. The City is accountable for the general public right-of-way (curb to suppress), from one side of the street to another. The homeowner is accountable for the area from the curb to the back of their residential or commercial property line. Easements (typically 10 feet large) where main sewers pass through personal property are an exception to this guideline.</p>
