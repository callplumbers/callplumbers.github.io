The threaded water system shank that fits through the bottom of the tank is not consisted of in this measurement. The addition of a backflow preventer reduces water service pressure to the building; additional, more significant costs can occur if the drop in water pressure becomes a concern for residents. If installing a pump or larger size water service and backflow prevention device would neutralize the pressure loss, a PE or RA can help determine.</p>

The homeowner is accountable for the area from the curb to the back of their property line. Easements (typically 10 feet wide) where main drains traverse private property are an exception to this guideline.</p>
