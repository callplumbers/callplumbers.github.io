<p>However, the majority of the time, it's safe to say that any repairs that need to be completed will come out of the wallet of a property owner. Plumbing Codes and State law determine minimum requirements for backflow prevention. Public water systems such as the City Utilities Department should fulfill or surpass the state standards and bring the responsibility for enforcing them.</p>
