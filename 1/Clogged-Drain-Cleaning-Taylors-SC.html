For instance, a water-main break or the opening of a fire hydrant can trigger pipes to lose pressure. When that takes place, water is no longer pressed forward into the home, enabling it to stream backward into city water supplies.</p>

Running water: If the toilet runs even when it hasn't been just recently used and you've changed the flapper, the issue might be bigger than it appears. The tank eventually loses its capability to seal correctly, creating waste and a higher water bill.</p>
