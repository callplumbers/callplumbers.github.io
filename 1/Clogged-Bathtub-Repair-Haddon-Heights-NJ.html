<p>Button Plumbing was great. They replaced my kitchen faucet and added two brand-new shut off valves under the sink which had constantly dripped in the previous if I shut down the water under the sink. I mentioned that my bathroom sink was draining sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into.

I was extremely happy with their service.</p>
