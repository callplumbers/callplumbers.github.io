<p>Aside from these two important components, there are a myriad of little, possibly less critical things that can weaken or break. For instance, if you lose your toilet bowl bolt covers (those little caps on the base of the toilet), the bolts holding your toilet to the floor will wear away much more rapidly. Consistent gross smells coming from the toilet can suggest you need a new wax ring where your toilet attaches to the floor drain. If the float rod of your fill valve isn't lifting correctly, you may need a brand-new cap for the fill valve. Bulges in the supply line can burst and cause a leak. Tank covers can split and leave your toilet's inner workings exposed if mishandled. While this won't impact the function of your toilet, it definitely doesn't do much for the aesthetic of your bathroom.
