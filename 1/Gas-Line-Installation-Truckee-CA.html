<p>Your kitchen sink is an essential part of your house, that makes its plumbing's effective functioning a requirement more than a need. Once the test results show the repair is complete, it is time to re-pressurize the plumbing system that was separated during the repair process. It is important that the plumbing system be turned on extremely gradually to assure no damage is done to the piping system. When the system is pressurized, air should be removed from the plumbing system. When re-pressurized, each outlet on the plumbing system must be checked to make sure no valves were unintentionally left open or did not close properly. As soon as the plumbing system is pressurized, make sure all valves are entirely open and notify the water user that the plumbing system has actually been gone back to service.</p>
<p>Do not put whatever down your garbage disposal. It is necessary to view what you put down your garbage disposal. Foods like rice and pasta can swell when combined with water, and potentially cause a clog. Vegetables and fruit peels can likewise trigger blockages and jams - think about composting or placing these products in the garbage. Additionally, grease and oil can cake and collect in your drain as well. After finishing cooking, think about pouring remaining grease or oil into a container or bowl to reserve.

<p>Your house's drainage works by the basic force of gravity. When you flush water and lose down your sink or shower (and your toilets too) it's not actually the circulation of water pressing them down your pipes. Rather, once they decrease your drain, gravity takes control of as the pipes under the ground are pitched at a downward angle to the sewer line. When something blocks the pipes, anything you pour down there won't go through.</p>
