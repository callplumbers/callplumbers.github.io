<p>Although it might be tempting to gather over-the-counter drain-clearing products, lots of plumbers advise against it. Not just are the chemicals poisonous if exposed to human skin, they might also harm drain pipes if excessive used. There are extra issues that might turn up, which is why our knowledgeable plumbers will perform a comprehensive inspection of your system to identify what has triggered it to breakdown.

<p>Your waste disposal unit ensures that your sink and plumbing fixtures don't get clogged. Contrary to some people's understanding, garbage disposals do not consist of blades. Instead, a waste disposal unit includes two stationary bolts that are fixed to a spinning disk. When the disposal is switched on the disks quickly spin, and these bolts require food and debris to grind against a stationary grinder along the periphery of the spinning disk. This high-speed action successfully crushes the food waste in the disposal so that it can take a trip down the drain without blocking.</p>
