Section 312.10 of the Ohio Plumbing Code covers the installation, repairs and testing of seclusion backflow preventers (BFP) and Area 608 of the Ohio Plumbing Code addresses protection of the safe and clean supply of water within a building these devices are known as seclusion" BFP. Once again, the very best kind of backflow prevention is an air gap, such as the outlet of a faucet and where water would stream over the rim of a sink or bathtub.

These BFP's, if testable, are required to be evaluated (by a certified backflow preventer tester) upon installation and at least every twelve months afterwards.</p>
