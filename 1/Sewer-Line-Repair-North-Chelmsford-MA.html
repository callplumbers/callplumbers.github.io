<p>Suggestion: Contact local codes before trying to install a waste disposal unit. Some communities have plumbing codes that do not permit disposals because of limits on sewer capacity.

<p>Among the important things we concentrate on is the bathroom toilet. So many individuals and companies let the toilet waste water year after year with leaking or ineffective models.

<p>When the pressure in a private water system exceeds the pressure in the public water circulation lines that can trigger normal flow to reverse, backpressure happens.

Preventive cleaning for drains should be performed on all drains, including toilet, floor, tub and sink drains.</p>
