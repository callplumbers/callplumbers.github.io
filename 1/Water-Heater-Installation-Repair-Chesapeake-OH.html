Boosts in downstream pressure can be produced by pumps, temperature level increases in boilers, etc. Reductions in safe and clean water supply pressure take place whenever the quantity of water being utilized goes beyond the amount of water being provided, such as during water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water pipe.</p>

Exemptions, which are granted in exceptionally unusual cases where the building is deemed to not pose a risk to the water system, should be submitted with the DEP by a PE or RA on behalf of the homeowner. If your structure has an existing backflow preventer, but the DEP has no record of its installation, you need to have a licensed professional file a record illustration of the device, along with an initial test report of the device for DEP review.</p>
