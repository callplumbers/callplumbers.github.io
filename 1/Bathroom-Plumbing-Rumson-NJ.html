<p>If your flapper valve has a ball that floats at the end of a rod, gently listen and raise the rod. You might be able to stop the running by adjusting the float if the water shuts off. Some fill toilet valves have a float change screw on top (see Figure A below). If there is no adjustment screw, flex the float arm. If you have a Fluidmaster-style fill valve, make sure it's changed effectively (Photo 8). You don't need to empty the tank to make these changes.</p>
<p>Often, an untrained person will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the assumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair may be as basic as changing a couple of rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or may require the replacement of some of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester carries out a field test, he creates data on the functions of the assembly.  It ends up being the tester's duty to know what the field test data means for that specific assembly.  When an experienced tester interprets the information, he can determine what parts of the backflow prevention assembly stopped working the test and requires repair.</p>
