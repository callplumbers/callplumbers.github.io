<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow brought on by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or customer's safe and clean water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the safe and clean supply of water pressure) can arise from a boost in downstream pressure, a reduction in the potable water supply pressure, or a combination of both. Pumps can create increases in downstream pressure; temperature level increases in boilers, and so on. Decreases in safe and clean water system pressure occur whenever the amount of water being used exceeds the quantity of water being supplied, such as throughout water line flushing, fire combating, or breaks in water mains.</p>
