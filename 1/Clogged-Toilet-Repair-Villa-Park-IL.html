It's time to seek advice from the professionals if your water heater isn't doing its only task.</p>

<p>In some cases, an untrained person will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the assumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair may be as basic as changing a couple of rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or might need the replacement of some of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester performs a field test, he generates data on the operations of the assembly.  It ends up being the tester's duty to understand what the field test data suggests for that particular assembly.  When a trained tester translates the information, he can determine what parts of the backflow prevention assembly failed the test and needs repair.</p>
