How to tell if you have polybutylene pipes: If your pipes are white plastic and include the letters PB" in the printed label, you have polybutylene pipes and we recommend having them changed right away. Before you can ask for an inspection, you should first get the required license( s) for the work you plan to do. You can check out our License page for additional information on acquiring a permit. Once you acquire a permit you can commence with the work. However, you need to call for inspection before you cover or hide any work.</p>
