<p>Although it might be appealing to pour in non-prescription drain-clearing items, many plumbers recommend against it. Not only are the chemicals hazardous if exposed to human skin, they might also damage drain pipes if overused. There are additional concerns that may turn up, which is why our skilled plumbers will carry out a comprehensive inspection of your system to identify what has triggered it to malfunction. From there we can make a notified choice on whether your problem can be fixed by a basic repair or if replacing the waste disposal unit is ultimately the much better alternative.</p>
<p>In some cases, an inexperienced individual will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the presumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair may be as easy as replacing a few rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or may need the replacement of a few of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester performs a field test, he produces data on the functions of the assembly.  It becomes the tester's task to understand what the field test data indicates for that specific assembly.  When a trained tester analyzes the data, he can determine what parts of the backflow prevention assembly failed the test and requires repair.</p>
