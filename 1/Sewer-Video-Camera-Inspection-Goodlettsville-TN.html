Sufficient drainage needs to also be supplied.</p>

It is NOT the exact same thing as a Double Check despite the fact that it might be marketed as one! Don't get duped! Pressure loss through a check valve tends to be about 3 PSI. Dual Checks have losses similar to Check (5 PSI).</p>

<p>Salt Water Valve - Controls water circulation in and out of salt tank. Features automated shut-off to avoid overfilling. Water in a gas pipe is almost certainly from a leak, not from "condensation" as the water content of LP or gas is extremely low. Rainwater which has not infiltrated the earth is an extremely pure kind of water. When water evaporates it leaves behind dissolved solids i.e. calcium and magnesium ions. Therefore when vaporized water eventually falls as rain - it is soft.</p>
