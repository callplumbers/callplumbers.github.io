Water pressure may be or stop working lowered when a water pipe bursts, pipes freeze, or there is all of a sudden high need on the water system (for example, when a number of fire hydrants are opened). Lowered pressure in the pipe might permit polluted water from the soil, from storage, or from other sources to be drawn up into the system.</p>
