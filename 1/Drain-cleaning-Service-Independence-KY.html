The homeowner is accountable for the area from the curb to the back of their property line. Easements (normally 10 feet broad) where main drains pass through private property are an exception to this guideline.</p>
<p>For instance, a plumber on a forum sponsored by tool producer Ridgid reports charging $125 for a camera inspection done as part of cleaning out a sewer line with a cable and cutting blade (called snaking) or $225 if done separately. And video inspection rates at Allied Drain Cleaning 1 in Connecticut begin at $175, while Covenant Pipeline 2 in California charges a minimum of $275 for approximately 2 hours and $175 per hour for each extra hour.</p>
