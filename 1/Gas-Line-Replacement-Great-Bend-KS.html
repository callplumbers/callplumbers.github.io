<p>Recent advances in toilet innovation have actually made modern-day restrooms much more comfortable and functional. If your toilet was produced prior to 1994, then it's most likely costing you cash every day. New toilets utilize almost two gallons less per flush while offering the same or better flushing power as their out-of-date counterparts.

<h3>Hose Bib Repair in Great Bend Kansas</h2>
<p>A partial reroute is essentially a small scale repiping of several afflicted locations of the plumbing below the slab. In cases where jackhammering and repairing the pipe are not cost efficient, it is possible to just abandon the afflicted section of pipe and reroute the line through the walls, attics and ceilings. Costing less than a complete repipe, the end outcome is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that may leak again in the future. We have experienced homes having 2 or more slab leaks within a 1-2 year duration, and these repairs can accumulate in cost extremely rapidly. This is the main reason we will recommend a full repipe in certain communities, based upon our experience.</p>
<p>Clearly the resin is not a limitless exchange site. When all the sodium exchange sites are replaced with hardness minerals, the resin is spent and will no longer soften water. At this point, the water softener will need to be operated on an alternate cycle called regrowth. During this cycle, resin is backwashed with a salt option. The salt water is reverse flushed through the system taking with it the calcium and magnesium ions that had actually been adsorbed on the resin. When backwashing is total, the softener can be gone back to use. Some water softeners will instantly switch to the operation cycle. Others have a manual switch. Figure 1 shows both cycles of the water softening process-ion exchange and regeneration.</p>
<p>Water softeners will run to drain during backwash and fast rinse anywhere from 2 to 4 GPM (depending on the size of the system). Each cycle will discharge 25 to 50 gallons of water with high levels of hardness minerals and chloride that you may not want just running outside. Not to point out plumbing code might be violated without appropriate backflow prevention.</p>
