<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow triggered by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or customer's safe and clean water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the safe and clean supply of water pressure) can result from an increase in downstream pressure, a decrease in the drinkable supply of water pressure, or a mix of both. Pumps can develop increases in downstream pressure; temperature level boosts in boilers, etc. Reductions in safe and clean water supply pressure take place whenever the quantity of water being utilized goes beyond the quantity of water being supplied, such as during water line flushing, fire combating, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
