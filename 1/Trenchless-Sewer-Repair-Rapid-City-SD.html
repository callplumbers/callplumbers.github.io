<p>Don't put everything down your garbage disposal. It is very important to view what you put down your garbage disposal. Foods like rice and pasta can swell when mixed with water, and potentially trigger a clog. Fruit and vegetable peels can also cause clogs and jams - think about composting or positioning these items in the garbage. Additionally, grease and oil can congeal and collect in your drain as well. After finishing cooking, consider pouring leftover grease or oil into a container or bowl to set aside. You can then use and reheat for other cooking or quickly place in the garbage after it's solidified.</p>
