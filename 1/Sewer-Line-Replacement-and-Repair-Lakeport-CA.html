This gas is made from a hydrocarbon called methane, unofficially called marsh gas or swamp gas.

As helpful as this gas is, the features that make this gas hazardous is its odorless and colorless nature, that makes it a quiet killer.

Make certain to just rely on an utmost professional with your gas line repair in Richmond.</p>
