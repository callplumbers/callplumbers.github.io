<p>Your garbage disposal guarantees that your sink and plumbing fixtures do not get clogged. Contrary to some individuals's understanding, garbage disposals do not contain blades. Rather, a waste disposal unit features two stationary bolts that are fixed to a spinning disk. When the disposal is switched on the disks quickly spin, and these bolts require food and particles to grind versus a fixed grinder along the periphery of the spinning disk. This high-speed action efficiently pulverizes the food waste in the disposal so that it can take a trip down the drain without clogging.</p>
