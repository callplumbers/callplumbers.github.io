<p>Organic debris, such as grease, food, or hair stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is typically the cause of clogged drains.

You can attempt to do this yourself, however this isn't a beginner's DIY job. If you utilize the tool improperly, you can damage your pipes and cause other leakages - so it deserves it to call somebody who knows the drill.</p>
