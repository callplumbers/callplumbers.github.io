Backpressure can be triggered by pumps or temperature level boosts in boilers, or if there is a reduction in the water system pressure. Backsiphonage happens when unfavorable or reduced pressure establishes in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, typically due to an interruption or drain in the supply, such as water main repairs or breaks, or neighboring firefighting activity. To avoid backflow, a backflow preventer device is installed on each main water service line-- domestic and fire water-- feeding the building. A common kind of backflow preventer is the reduced pressured zone (RPZ) assembly.</p>
