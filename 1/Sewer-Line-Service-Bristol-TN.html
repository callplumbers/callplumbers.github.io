<p>Aside from these 2 important elements, there are a myriad of little, perhaps less important things that can break or weaken. For example, if you lose your toilet bowl bolt covers (those little caps on the base of the toilet), the bolts holding your toilet to the floor will rust far more rapidly. Consistent gross smells coming from the toilet can indicate you need a new wax ring where your toilet attaches to the floor drain. You may need a brand-new cap for the fill valve if the float rod of your fill valve isn't raising properly. Bulges in the supply line can cause a leak and burst. Tank covers can crack and leave your toilet's inner functions exposed if mishandled. While this won't affect the function of your toilet, it certainly doesn't do much for the visual of your bathroom. We're not attempting to psych you out by pointing out all the important things that can fail, the point is - your toilet is a total component and every part requires to be in good shape for it to operate at its best.</p>
