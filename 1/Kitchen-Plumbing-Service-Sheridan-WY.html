<p>A general rule is that you can recapture the cost of the repair if the problems happens well outside that 8 to 12 year life-span. If, say, you need a new burner set and the hot water heater is 5 years of ages, then it makes sense for you to spend the $120 for the part, specifically if you can do the work yourself.

The factor is that some other part on the appliance will go or its tank will leak. And there's no remedy for a leaking tank.</p>
