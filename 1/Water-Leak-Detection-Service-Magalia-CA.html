Backpressure can be caused by pumps or temperature level increases in boilers, or if there is a decrease in the water system pressure. Backsiphonage takes place when negative or decreased pressure develops in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, normally due to a disturbance or drain in the supply, such as water main repairs or breaks, or nearby firefighting activity.
