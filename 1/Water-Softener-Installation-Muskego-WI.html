It was set up 7 years ago, and it never drained this well. I picked this company since they had fantastic reviews and a fair price, and although the task took a lot more time and work than they expected it to, they honored their quote. I will utilize Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing requires in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were beasts. They had a huge, disgusting mess on their hands (actually), and they did a great job cleaning up after it too.</p>
