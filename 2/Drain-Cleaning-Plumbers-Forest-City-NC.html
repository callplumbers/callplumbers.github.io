<p>Sooner or later, however, the beads reach optimal capacity and can't attract anymore mineral ions. At that point, the softener tank should be restored, or, flushed clean. That's where the salt water tank can be found in. An on-board computer system computes the quantity of water that streams through the softener. Regeneration automatically begins when it reaches the preprogrammed setting. For a three-bedroom home and family of 4, regrowth generally happens every 12,000 gallons.</p>
