<p>While combating a fire, firemens are naturally more concerned about drawing enough water to splash the blaze than backflow prevention. Not only will they use water from any offered source to achieve their goal, but fire department lorries frequently bring non-potable water treated with antifreeze, rust inhibitors, or extinguishing representatives.</p>
<p>Carefully listen and lift the rod if your flapper valve has a ball that floats at the end of a rod. You might be able to stop the running by adjusting the float if the water shuts off. Some fill toilet valves have a float adjustment screw on top (see Figure A below). If there is no change screw, flex the float arm. Make sure it's adjusted effectively (Picture 8)if you have a Fluidmaster-style fill valve. You don't have to clear the tank to make these modifications.</p>
