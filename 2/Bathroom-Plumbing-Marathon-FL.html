<p>Video cameras are one of the most important tools in the plumbing service. When looking for a brand-new flapper, your best option is to try and find the exact same flapper that originally came with your existing flush valve.

If you don't know your model number, however, we do use an extensive selection of "will fit" flappers to assist you out. Watch the video below for more information about the different type of flappers readily available, or visit How To Replace Toilet Flappers for short tutorials on altering toilet flappers, tank balls, and flush valve seals.</p>
<p>Filtration in sink taps and refrigerator water dispensers improves water's taste, but its steep price tag makes it unwise as a household option.
