<p>Filtration in sink taps and refrigerator water dispensers enhances water's taste, but its steep price tag makes it unwise as a household service.

A clogged sewer pipe could leave you ripe for a drain-cleaning rip-off.</p>

<p>Clogged toilets are among the most typical plumbing issues plumbers face, and for many people, it's an emergency when the toilet is all set to overflow. You can attempt to fix the clog yourself by using a plunger, which you can buy at your local hardware shop. The only purpose of salt in a water softener is to restore the resin beads that take the solidity out of water.</p>
<p>Loose flanges are generally the outcome of wood rot. The flange screws merely will not keep in the soft, decayed subfloor. The very best solution depends upon the level of the rot. Use an ear-type repair ring if the rot is just under the flange. The ears let you drive screws into firm wood further away from the flange. Before you install this type of ring, hold it as much as the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You might have to cut off a couple of ears to make it deal with your toilet. You'll have to replace a section of the subfloor if the rot extends well beyond the flange.</p>
