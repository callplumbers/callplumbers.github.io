If your package just includes a waste arm, it is possible - though not advised - to connect this to the disposer discharge elbow using a slip joint. The successive 90 ° turns in such a setup can result in incorrect drainage. Depending on the length of the waste arm, you may be able to cut off its elbow and use the remainder as a straight discharge tube.</p>
<p>Organic particles, such as hair, grease, or food stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is typically the reason for clogged drains. The most common method a plumber unblocks P-traps is with a tool called a plumber's snake, cable television or drain auger. The tool is thoroughly placed down your drain to clear it of buildup. You can try to do this yourself, but this isn't a novice's DIY task. If you utilize the tool improperly, you can harm your pipes and trigger other leaks - so it deserves it to call somebody who understands the drill.</p>
