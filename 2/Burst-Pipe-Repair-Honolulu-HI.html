<h3>Kitchen Drain in Honolulu Hawaii</h2>
<p>A partial reroute is generally a small scale repiping of one or more afflicted locations of the plumbing beneath the slab. In cases where fixing the pipe and jackhammering are not cost effective, it is possible to just abandon the affected area of pipe and reroute the line through the ceilings, walls and attics. Costing less than a full repipe, the end result is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that might leak again in the future. We have actually experienced homes having 2 or more slab leaks within a 1-2 year duration, and these repairs can add up in cost very quickly. This is the main reason that we will advise a full repipe in particular communities, based on our experience.</p>
<p>Plainly the resin is not an endless exchange site. When all the sodium exchange sites are replaced with firmness minerals, the resin is spent and will no longer soften water. At this point, the water softener will need to be operated on an alternate cycle called regrowth. During this cycle, resin is backwashed with a salt service. The brine is reverse flushed through the system taking with it the calcium and magnesium ions that had been adsorbed on the resin. Once backwashing is complete, the softener can be gone back to utilize. Some water softeners will immediately change to the operation cycle. Others have a manual switch. Figure 1 shows both cycles of the water softening process-ion exchange and regrowth.</p>
