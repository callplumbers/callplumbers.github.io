Your plumber might replace the tank-to-bowl connections, or the gasket around the floor hole. Compared to the day-to-day costs and aggravations sustained by hard water, a water softener is eventually an investment that will save you a considerable amount of money. The cost of the water softener system is greatly exceeded by the money and energy saved.</p>
