<p>When the hardware parts have been cleaned and checked and the rubber parts have actually been changed, now reassemble the parts back into their components. Some parts may have extremely tight tolerances that need to be preserved. An essential thing to recognize on each component is the guide. The guide is the part that directs or steadies the movement of the element. The guide is a very vital part of the design of each part. If the element is not fixed correctly, the guide could restrict the movement (instead of direct or constant) of the part, which might trigger the element to not work to its capabilities. Many times springs are incorrectly blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. For the most part the guides are limiting the travel of the part causing lower test results than what is required.</p>
