If it bubbles, you likely have a gas leak and must right away contact a gas plumber to perform an emergency gas line repair.</p>
<p>Requirements in NFPA 13: Standard for the Installation of Sprinkler Systems for installing backflow preventers and in NFPA 25: Requirement for the Inspection, Testing and Maintenance of Water-Based Fire Security Systems for performing annual forward circulation tests are sometimes viewed as a mandate to have them.

<p>Typically brought on by slow seepage from the tank into the bowl. Put a couple of drops of food coloring in the tank. Wait an hour, then see and check if you see coloring in the bowl. This indicates a leaky flapper valve. Replacement is generally the fix. Additionally, sometimes a defective fill valve may actuate intermittently, as well. Water won't drain or is draining pipes gradually through the disposal.</p>
<p>It helps to understand the brand and model of your toilet. The brand is normally on the bowl behind the seat.
