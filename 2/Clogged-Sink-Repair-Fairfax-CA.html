<p>A hot water heater leak can be a symptom of a vast array of problems, all of which must be repaired instantly to prevent overall appliance failure.

<p>When the pressure in the system is higher than the pressure of the incoming safe and clean water supply, backpressure backflow in a building results. Backpressure can be caused by pumps or temperature increases in boilers, or if there is a decrease in the water system pressure. Backsiphonage happens when unfavorable or lower pressure develops in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, generally due to a disturbance or drain in the supply, such as water pipe repairs or breaks, or nearby firefighting activity. To prevent backflow, a backflow preventer device is installed on each main water service line-- domestic and fire water-- feeding the structure. A common type of backflow preventer is the reduced pressured zone (RPZ) assembly.</p>

Before you install this sort of ring, hold it approximately the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You may have to cut off a number of ears to make it deal with your toilet. You'll have to replace a section of the subfloor if the rot extends well beyond the flange.</p>
