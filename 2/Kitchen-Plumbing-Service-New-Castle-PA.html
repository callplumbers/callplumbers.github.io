Mineral deposits can settle on the tank's bottom, leaving less room for water - which will suggest that less water will be heated and readily available for use. Likewise, rust of the tank's aspects can cause the tank to have a brief life. Request that a new one be set up if the water heater is old or you see apparent indications of corrosion.</p>
