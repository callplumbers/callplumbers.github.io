<p>Backflow implies the undesirable turnaround of circulation of a liquid, gas, or suspended solid into the potable supply of water; a backflow preventer is developed to keep this from happening. Points at which a potable water system gets in touch with a non-potable water supply are called cross connections. Such connections occur naturally in devices such as clothing washers and dishwashers, however they must be thoroughly developed and installed to avoid backflow. Another typical area for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water pipe, to avoid pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the public supply of water.</p>
<p>When a flush valve causes a toilet to run, a used flapper is usually the perpetrator. But not constantly. Initially, look at the chain that raises the flapper. It can tangle up and prevent the flapper from closing firmly if there's too much slack in the chain. A chain with too little slack can trigger problem too. Picture 3 shows how to set the slack ideal.</p>

So, if you are not looking specifically for a different disposal this may be something to think about.
