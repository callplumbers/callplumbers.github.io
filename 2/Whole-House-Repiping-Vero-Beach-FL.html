<p>The individual who does the testing needs to be a certified backflow tester. Not all licensed plumbers have this accreditation, and a plumbing license is not required to get this certification. I have actually contacted a few plumbers, and the prices quoted for backflow testing ranged from $150 - $250, however I would expect the cost to be considerably less from backflow testers who are not licensed plumbers.</p>

<p>You can utilize a wire coat hanger by correcting it if you don't have a plumber's snake. Obviously, it won't reach as far as a plumber's snake would, however it may be long enough to reach some clogs.
