<p>Backflow suggests the unwanted reversal of circulation of a liquid, gas, or suspended solid into the safe and clean supply of water; a backflow preventer is created to keep this from taking place. Points at which a drinkable water system gets in touch with a non-potable water system are called cross connections. Such connections occur naturally in devices such as clothes washers and dishwashers, however they must be carefully created and set up to prevent backflow. Another typical location for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water main, to avoid pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the public water supply.</p>
