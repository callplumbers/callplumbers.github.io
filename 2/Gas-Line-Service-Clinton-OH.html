<p>George from Clog Dawg was professional, efficient, and an excellent person. He informed me exactly what to anticipate (cost, time, procedure) in advance and provided as guaranteed. I will definitely use Clog Dawg again. Installing a waste disposal unit takes 2 to 3 hours with a typical per hour rate of $25 to $70. These costs are in addition to the cost of the disposal unit. The overall you pay might be higher if your plumber has a minimum callout cost that is greater than the labor cost for the work.</p>
<p>There are 2 types of products used to develop a garbage disposal system: aluminum and stainless steel. The typical cost of an aluminum waste disposal unit ranges from $60 to $150, while a stainless-steel waste disposal unit has a typical cost of simply over $150. Sewer pipes can be infamously hard to trace, specifically on older properties, so you'll wish to hire somebody who will trace the problem at its origin.</p>
