<p>George from Clog Dawg was professional, efficient, and a great person. He informed me precisely what to anticipate (cost, time, process) in advance and delivered as assured. I will certainly utilize Clog Dawg once again. Installing a garbage disposal takes 2 to 3 hours with a typical per hour rate of $25 to $70. These rates remain in addition to the cost of the disposal unit. If your plumber has a minimum callout fee that is higher than the labor cost for the work, the overall you pay might be greater.</p>
<p>Cost of associated materials and supplies normally needed to install garbage disposal consisting of: adapters, fittings and mounting hardware. You can save cash.
