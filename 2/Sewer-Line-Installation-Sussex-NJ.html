Since these systems do not work by exchanging ions, like traditional water softeners do, one advantage claimed for the user is the elimination of the need to include salt to the system. While particle size reduction and plant development promotion have been declared, such systems do not remove minerals from the water itself. Rather, they can only change the downstream effects that the mineral-bearing water would otherwise have. Testing of particular systems has shown a reduction of calcium scale formation. 11 These systems do not fall within the term "water softening" however rather "water conditioning".</p>

You might need a brand-new cap for the fill valve if the float rod of your fill valve isn't raising appropriately. Bulges in the supply line can burst and trigger a leak. Tank lids can crack and leave your toilet's inner functions exposed if mishandled. While this won't impact the function of your toilet, it certainly doesn't do much for the visual of your bathroom.
