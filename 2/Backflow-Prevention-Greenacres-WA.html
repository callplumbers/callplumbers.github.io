Oxidants such as chlorine in the general public supply of water react with the polybutylene piping and acetal fittings, triggering them to scale, flake, and end up being breakable. This leads to micro-fractures and reduces the standard structural integrity of the system. The system ends up being weak and might fail without caution, triggering damage to the building structure and personal property. Incorrect installation is also a common cause of polybutylene system failure, which can be nearly impossible to detect.</p>
