<h3>How To Keep Bathroom Sinks Running Smoothly in Elmwood Park NJ 07407</h3>
<p>Backflow suggests the unfavorable reversal of circulation of a liquid, gas, or suspended strong into the drinkable supply of water; a backflow preventer is created to keep this from happening. Points at which a potable water system connects with a non-potable water system are called cross connections. Such connections happen naturally in appliances such as clothing washers and dishwashing machines, but they must be carefully designed and installed to prevent backflow. Another common area for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water main, to prevent pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the general public supply of water.</p>
