Pumps can produce increases in downstream pressure; temperature level increases in boilers, and so on. Reductions in drinkable water supply pressure happen whenever the amount of water being used goes beyond the amount of water being provided, such as throughout water line flushing, fire battling, or breaks in water mains.</p>
