<p>As a locally-owned service, integrity and responsibility are exceptionally crucial to constructing a credibility for excellence. Section 312.10 of the Ohio Plumbing Code covers the installation, repairs and testing of isolation backflow preventers (BFP) and Area 608 of the Ohio Plumbing Code addresses defense of the drinkable water system within a building these devices are referred to as seclusion" BFP. Again, the very best kind of backflow prevention is an air space, such as the outlet of a faucet and where water would flow over the rim of a sink or bathtub. The Warren County Plumbing Department checks to ensure there is an air space, if there is no chance to provide one, then we inspect to see that the proper BFP device is set up.
