<p>When drains are clogged, it is not constantly due to clogs that come from inside the home. It is possible for drains to end up being clogged due to tree roots, also called tree root invasion. When tree roots begin to make their method inside someone's main sewer line, there is potential for this to cause drain problems. The kind of drain pipes currently installed, such as cast iron, clay, copper or plastic, will figure out the degree of the damage that tree roots can cause to a sewer line.</p>
<p>If a cable television has not yet been run to the junction box, you can make the connections within the brand-new disposer whenever beforehand, signing up with the cable television to the wires in package just before or simply after installing the disposer.
