You can try to fix the clog yourself by using a plunger, which you can purchase your local hardware store. The only purpose of salt in a water softener is to regenerate the resin beads that take the firmness out of water.</p>
<p>Improvement plumbers usually charge at least $45 to $65 per hour for one guy and a truck. Again, this does not consist of the cost of parts. However a growing number of plumbers are charging "by the fixture," and their quotes are based on the rough-in for drain and supply lines ($ 300 to $400 in my area) and installation of the components themselves (about $200). Plumbing parts and components for a powder room with a sink and toilet run $1,000 to $1,200, though you can easily invest a lot more.
