Boosts in downstream pressure can be created by pumps, temperature increases in boilers, etc. Decreases in potable supply of water pressure occur whenever the quantity of water being used goes beyond the amount of water being supplied, such as throughout water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
