<p>The most reliable method to resolve difficult water is with a water softener. Water is softened when calcium and magnesium-- the hardness ions-- are collected by tiny resin beads through a process called ion exchange. The resin beads are charged with sodium or potassium ions. When tough water is available in contact with the resin beads, the calcium and magnesium are pulled out of the water and changed with salt or potassium, leaving your water soft.</p>
