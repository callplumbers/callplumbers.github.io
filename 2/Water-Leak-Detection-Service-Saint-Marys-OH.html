<p>Your kitchen sink is an important part of your home, that makes its plumbing's effective functioning a requirement more than a need. When the test results reveal the repair is total, it is time to re-pressurize the plumbing system that was separated during the repair process. It is necessary that the plumbing system be turned on really slowly to assure no damage is done to the piping system. As soon as the system is pressurized, air must be removed from the plumbing system. When re-pressurized, each outlet on the plumbing system need to be inspected to ensure no valves were accidentally left open or did not close effectively. Once the plumbing system is pressurized, make sure all valves are completely open and inform the water user that the plumbing system has actually been gone back to service.</p>

<p>A. Normally wax doesn't "go bad" on a standard floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to avoid leakages. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet is there to avoid smells. If you are experiencing a leak originating from beneath the floor-mounted toilet, you most likely have a partial (or full blown) toilet blockage down the drain line (or the toilet is split in the bowl). Likewise, make sure the leak isn't originating from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "common" unnoticed problem. If you aren't sure where the leak is originating from, attempt putting a couple of drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a couple of hours.</p>
