Oxidants such as chlorine in the general public supply of water react with the polybutylene piping and acetal fittings, causing them to scale, flake, and end up being fragile. This results in micro-fractures and reduces the standard structural stability of the system. The system ends up being weak and might fail without warning, triggering damage to the building structure and personal property. Inappropriate installation is also a common reason for polybutylene system failure, which can be nearly difficult to identify.</p>
