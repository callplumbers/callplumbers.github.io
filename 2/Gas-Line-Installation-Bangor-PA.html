<p>Organic debris, such as food, hair, or grease stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is often the cause of clogged drains. The most common way a plumber unblocks P-traps is with a tool called a plumber's snake, cable or drain auger. The tool is carefully inserted down your drain to clear it of accumulation.

If you use the tool incorrectly, you can damage your pipes and trigger other leaks - so it deserves it to call somebody who knows the drill.</p>
