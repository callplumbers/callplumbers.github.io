<p>As soon as the hardware parts have been cleaned up and inspected and the rubber parts have been changed, now reassemble the parts back into their elements. Some components may have extremely tight tolerances that need to be maintained. A crucial thing to identify on each element is the guide. The guide is the part that steadies the motion or directs of the part. The guide is an extremely vital part of the design of each element. If the part is not fixed properly, the guide might limit the motion (instead of steady or direct) of the element, which could trigger the component to not work to its capabilities.

In most cases the guides are limiting the travel of the component triggering lower test results than what is needed.</p>
