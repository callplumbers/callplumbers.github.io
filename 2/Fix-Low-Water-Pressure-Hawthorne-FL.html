If you smell a strong whiff of gas from your vehicle when it is running, you may have a gas leak from the fuel line. It is important to repair this immediately to avoid a surge. It is best to take your vehicle to a certified mechanic if you are not certain of your repair capabilities.</p>
<p>When a flush valve causes a toilet to run, a used flapper is usually the culprit. However not constantly. First, look at the chain that raises the flapper. It can tangle up and avoid the flapper from closing strongly if there's too much slack in the chain. A chain with too little slack can cause difficulty too. Image 3 demonstrates how to set the slack just right.</p>
