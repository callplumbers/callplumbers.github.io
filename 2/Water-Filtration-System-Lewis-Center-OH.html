It was set up 7 years ago, and it never drained this well. I selected this company because they had great evaluations and a reasonable cost, and despite the fact that the task took a lot more time and work than they expected it to, they honored their quote. I will use Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing requires in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were beasts. They had a substantial, horrible mess on their hands (actually), and they did a great job cleaning up after it as well.</p>
