When the system is pressurized, air should be removed from the plumbing system. When re-pressurized, each outlet on the plumbing system ought to be checked to ensure no valves were unintentionally left open or did not close effectively. Once the plumbing system is pressurized, be sure all valves are entirely open and alert the water user that the plumbing system has been gone back to service.</p>
