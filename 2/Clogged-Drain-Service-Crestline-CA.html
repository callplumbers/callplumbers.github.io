<p>Gas is tough to identify, as it's a colorless, odor-free compound. We utilize gas in our homes with gas heaters, ovens, and stoves. American homes gain access to natural gas through miles and miles of underground pipelines. Having a natural gas leak from an outdoor pipeline and indoor devices can happen rapidly and unexpectedly.
