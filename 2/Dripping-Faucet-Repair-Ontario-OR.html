<p>Remember that repiping a home is a major plumbing repair, and you must only hire a trusted and well-respected contractor like Cabrillo in order to make sure that the task is done right.

<p>When sewer line breaks, it often triggers the lawn above it to become soaked. You might smell the horrible odor of sewage before you feel the squish of your lawn under your feet (hopefully shoed feet!).

Easements (usually 10 feet wide) where main sewers traverse personal property are an exception to this guideline.</p>
