<p>Remember that repiping a home is a major plumbing repair, and you must only hire a trusted and well-respected contractor like Cabrillo in order to make sure that the task is done right. The average cost to install a drip leg is $75 to $150, which is a plumber's minimum charge. For several installs, costs vary from $33 to $89 per drip leg. Leak legs capture moisture so that it doesn't go into the control system. Although small pieces of sediment might get through a drip leg.</p>
<p>When sewer line breaks, it often triggers the lawn above it to become soaked. You might smell the horrible odor of sewage before you feel the squish of your lawn under your feet (hopefully shoed feet!).

Plumbers describe a sewer line break as a plumbing emergency. Ideally, your Evanston plumber's contact number is on your speed dial.</p>

Easements (usually 10 feet wide) where main sewers traverse personal property are an exception to this guideline.</p>
