Backpressure can be brought on by pumps or temperature level increases in boilers, or if there is a decline in the water system pressure. Backsiphonage happens when negative or reduced pressure establishes in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, typically due to an interruption or drain in the supply, such as water main repairs or breaks, or neighboring firefighting activity. To avoid backflow, a backflow preventer device is installed on each main water service line-- domestic and fire water-- feeding the structure. A typical type of backflow preventer is the lowered pressured zone (RPZ) assembly.</p>

For this leak, you will wish to unscrew the drain, and clean it thoroughly. If it is set in location, get rid of all of the previous plumber's putty by using a scraper.</p>

But the intent of the code is to just connect installation and ITM requirements to systems where backflow preventers are present.</p>
