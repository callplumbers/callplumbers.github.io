<p>When water is hard, it can clog pipes and soap will dissolve in it less quickly. Water softening can prevent these negative impacts. Natural gas is a colorless, odor-free fuel. As a security preventative measure, we include a chemical odorant called mercaptan that provides gas a smell frequently associated with rotten eggs. This unique aroma allows you to smell a possible leak if it occurs. Always leave if you suspect a leak.</p>
<p>This is an indication you may need a toilet repair or replacement if you are finding yourself flushing the toilet more than regular (or even more than once). This might be a sign that the system that flushes needs replaced, the water jets are just not working to flush the excrement down, or your water pressure is too low.
