<p>Button Plumbing was great. They replaced my kitchen faucet and added 2 brand-new shut off valves under the sink which had actually constantly leaked in the previous if I shut off the water under the sink. I pointed out that my bathroom sink was draining slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were very friendly and got the work done quickly. The cost was quite reasonable. I will absolutely utilize them for any future plumbing needs. I was super happy with their service.</p>

<p>Double Check Valve (DCV) - safe for usage both inside and underground, DCVs are a little bit more pricey but are also highly practical, as they can be installed horizontally or vertically. Camera are useful in locating buried septic tanks or inspecting the condition of buried pipes to figure out proper maintenance schedules or the extent of necessary repairs. When the corrupt sales representative takes control of the camera, he might play a pre-taped inspection of a pipe in really bad condition and say it is your pipe.</p>
<p>Anode Rod Failure: This metal rod is generally made from aluminum or magnesium and remains as a point of contact with the water in your tank. This is so that it can draw in the irons that would normally trigger rust. After extended usage, these rods will eventually become worn and need to be changed. If you do not replace them, you could experience significant problems with your water heater extremely rapidly, not to mention finding that reddish-brown color in your water</p>
<p>There's a great possibility you have galvanized pipes if you have an older home. And if your home was integrated in the 1970s or earlier, those pipes are probably nearing completion of their life-span. As galvanized pipes age, they start to wear away. This rust can cause an accumulation of lead, which can have lots of negative impacts on your health. Rusty pipes also cause bad water quality and low water pressure.</p>
