<p>Backflow means the unwanted turnaround of flow of a liquid, gas, or suspended solid into the potable water system; a backflow preventer is designed to keep this from happening. Points at which a potable water system gets in touch with a non-potable water supply are called cross connections. Such connections take place naturally in devices such as clothes washers and dishwashers, but they need to be carefully designed and installed to prevent backflow. Another typical location for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water pipe, to avoid pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the general public water supply.</p>
