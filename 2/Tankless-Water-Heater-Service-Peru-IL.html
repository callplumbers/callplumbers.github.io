Blanc also developed a much bigger variation of the Roto-Rooter machine called the Roto-Rooter Royal. It needed to be hauled by a truck and included a 10 hp gas engine and 1000 feet of steel cable television. It was capable of cleaning big commercial and municipal sewer pipes. An enhanced version called "The Mainliner" was presented in 1958 that might also thread telephone cable television. It was terminated in 1973.</p>
<p>If there's an existing disposal, use the useful self-service wrenchette to disengage the old system from the bottom of the sink. It will suit the holes on bottom piece of the bracket.
