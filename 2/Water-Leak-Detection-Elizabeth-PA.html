<p>Water softeners typically have a lifespan of 15 years, nevertheless, water softener systems can last a lot longer if they are effectively maintained. Making sure the brine tank never runs out of salt will extend the unit's life.  Protecting the resin bed from high levels of iron and manganese will also protect the system.
