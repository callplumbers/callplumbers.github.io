<p>Backpressure backflow in a building results when the pressure in the system is greater than the pressure of the inbound potable water system. Backpressure can be brought on by pumps or temperature level boosts in boilers, or if there is a reduction in the water system pressure. Backsiphonage happens when negative or reduced pressure establishes in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, generally due to a disruption or drain in the supply, such as water main repairs or breaks, or close-by firefighting activity. To prevent backflow, a backflow preventer device is set up on each main water service line-- domestic and fire water-- feeding the structure. A common type of backflow preventer is the minimized pressured zone (RPZ) assembly.</p>
