You have probably seen drain cleaner items on the racks at your local house improvement store, so when your drain gets clogged or isn't draining water like it should, you may be lured to head down there and pick some as much as fix it on your own. These items, after all, make the procedure seem pretty easy. Regrettably it's not as easy as you might believe, and those items are not always going to fix the problem.
