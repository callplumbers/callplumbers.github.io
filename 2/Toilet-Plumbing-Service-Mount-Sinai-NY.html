<h3>Frozen Pipes in Mount Sinai New York</h2>

Throughout a camera inspection, a sewer and drain specialist runs a video cable television down sewer branch lines that lead from tubs, sinks, and other drains into the main sewer line. Utilizing the images recorded by the camera, we can pinpoint any sewer and drain line problems, such as blockages, tree root intrusion, misaligned joints, cracks, and other damage.</p>

Depending on the severity of the circumstance, only one piece may need replacement, or the entire under-sink assembly should be removed and changed.
