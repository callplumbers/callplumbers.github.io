Once the system is pressurized, air should be removed from the plumbing system. When re-pressurized, each outlet on the plumbing system need to be inspected to guarantee no valves were unintentionally left open or did not close properly. Once the plumbing system is pressurized, make sure all valves are totally open and inform the water user that the plumbing system has actually been gone back to service.</p>
