<p>Nearly all softeners fall into one of two classifications. Timed designs have programmable timeclocks that will regrow on a predetermined schedule and then return to service. Since they regenerate whether the resin requires it or not, these work well for households that are on regular water-using cycles but will lose more water and salt. Demand-control models, with either electrical and mechanical sensing units, generally restore after many gallons of water have been softened. If you have a rising and falling water use schedule, such designs are convenient.</p>
