Area 312.10 of the Ohio Plumbing Code covers the installation, repairs and testing of seclusion backflow preventers (BFP) and Area 608 of the Ohio Plumbing Code addresses security of the potable water system within a structure these gadgets are called isolation" BFP. Again, the very best type of backflow prevention is an air gap, such as the outlet of a faucet and where water would flow over the rim of a sink or bathtub. The Warren County Plumbing Department checks to ensure there is an air gap, if there is no other way to supply one, then we inspect to see that the appropriate BFP device is set up.

It is important to turn the inlet shut-off valve on slowly while the disadvantage shut down stays in the closed position.

Most backflow prevention assemblies have air bleeds or air screws so that air can be gotten rid of from crucial locations in the assembly.
