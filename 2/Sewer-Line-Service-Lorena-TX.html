<p>No, you should NOT pour caustic chemical drain cleaners down your drains if you're major about securing your drain and plumbing system. The factor is that these chemical cleaners can be far more damaging than practical, possibly eating away at your pipes. Repiping is the replacement of either a single pipe or a house's entire plumbing system, including both supply of water and drain lines. Normally, a whole-house repipe deserves the financial investment in the long run because it might attend to the root reason for the chronic plumbing problems in your house.</p>
<p>The best source for this kind of plumber is a general contractor. The contractor sees the plumber's work prior to it's covered up; you do not get that opportunity. In addition, your contractor understands the indicators of quality work that you may miss out on, like clean solder joints, crisp 90-degree angles at joints and clean, properly sized holes in studs, joists, and floorings. Finally, a quality contractor will not risk dealing with a shoddy plumber. An easy error-- a joint left unsoldered or a leaky PVC line-- can quickly devastate $10,000 worth of walls or hardwood floorings and complicate the job with insurance claims, lost time, and claims. With a lot riding on the plumber, contractors tend to stick with just the best.</p>
<p>No property owner wishes to handle dysfunctional plumbing, particularly when it can cost thousands in repairs. Your houses plumbing goes beyond just the pipes inside your house to the main sewer line that connects to them. A lot of significant plumbing problems normally take place on the main line, and it's best to avoid them as much as possible. Damaged sewer lines can lead to bathrooms flooded with sewage, damaged pipes, and pricey repairs.</p>

<p>Strong sewage smell in your bathroom and other areas of your house. A sewage odor emanating from your bathroom or another area of your house can be an indication of a major issue with your plumbing. Pipes in your home may have burst or otherwise broken.

<p>There's a good chance you have galvanized pipes if you have an older house. And if your house was built in the 1970s or earlier, those pipes are most likely nearing the end of their lifespan. As galvanized pipes age, they start to wear away. This corrosion can cause a buildup of lead, which can have many unfavorable results on your health. Rusty pipes also result in bad water quality and low water pressure.</p>
<p>Clear the trap: If the above techniques do not work, the next action would be to get rid of the P-trap under the sink. Place a bucket below the area to catch water then unscrew the two threaded caps that hold the curved section of the pipe in place. Nowadays, most kitchen drains are made from white PVC pipe with connections that can be unscrewed by hand.</p>
