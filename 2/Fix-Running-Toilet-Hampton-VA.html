<p>Strong sewage smell in your bathroom and other locations of your home. A sewage smell emanating from your bathroom or another area of your house can be an indication of a severe problem with your plumbing. Pipes in your home might have burst or otherwise broken.

Attempt putting a few drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a couple of hours if you aren't sure where the leak is coming from.</p>
<p>When to repair: Toilet blockages are not unusual, but if your toilet is obstructing more than three times a month, there's a larger issue to analyze. If your toilet is relatively brand-new, you might need to change toilet paper or hire a plumber to clear a blockage from the drain. The National Contractor License Service maintains a list of each state's professional licensing firm where you can look up your state's licensing information. Inspect the list of state licensing agencies to discover whether a plumber is licensed in your state. Angie's List likewise maintains a licensing tool to check state licensing requirements.</p>
