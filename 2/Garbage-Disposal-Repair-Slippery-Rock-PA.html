<p>The old disposal has to be disconnected initially. Garbage disposals are generally connected at the base and so this is where the procedure begins. Some electrical knowledge is required to make sure the wires are detached properly. Answer: No! They do not have a sprinkler system, or any outdoor watering system at all, so they do not need backflow prevention.</p>
<p>Without a plumbing camera inspection, a lot of drain issues can just be spotted once they start to back up. However, during routing plumbing inspections, a complete test of all drains will be performed. Plumbers can attempt to recreate problems to determine if something may be happening behind the walls or in the ground. Professional drain cleaning with cleanouts is much more reliable at getting rid of obstructions. Many houses have drain cleanouts, however, we experience older homes without cleanouts. If you are having drain problems, a professional plumber can include cleanouts to your house.</p>
