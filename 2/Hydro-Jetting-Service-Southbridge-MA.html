<p>The program accomplishes its objective by providing for the adoption and promulgation of appropriate rules and policies for the construction of plumbing facilities where mandated. Cold showers? High energy expenses? It might be time for a brand-new warm water heater. But in order to profit of a new energy-efficient appliance, you'll need to have it installed effectively. A water heater that is not installed correctly can lead to water damage, scalding temperatures, or perhaps a fire. That's why installation is best delegated professional plumbers who understand the ins and outs of your plumbing system.</p>
<p>Your storm drains do not go directly into the ground and into oblivion either, this water is generally transported elsewhere to a nearby treatment plant, a creek, and even the ocean in.
