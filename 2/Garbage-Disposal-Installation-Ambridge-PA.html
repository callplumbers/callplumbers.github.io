<p>Check the washer for wear or cracks when you get rid of the cap to flush out the valve. Replacing a bad washer is easy and inexpensive. But discovering the ideal washer might not be. The most common washers are frequently available in the house centers and hardware shops. Other designs can be difficult to find. If you decide to hunt for a washer, remove it and take it to the store to discover a match. Plumbers generally replace the entire fill valve instead of hunt for a replacement washer.</p>
