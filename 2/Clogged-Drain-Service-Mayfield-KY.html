<p>A total repipe of a home's water supply, often done to replace leaking polybutylene pipes, is the most costly and intricate plumbing task, says Steven Wood, president of Flo-Right Services, a plumbing company concentrating on entire home repiping. Recent Evaluation: Carlos and Lopez were fantastic. My 90 years of age Dad's sewer line clogged on Thanksgiving Day and Carlos came to 8am the next day to repair. Since of the age of the house and location of the pipe, it was a tough job. They worked for almost 12 hours into darkness to make certain the system was working before they left. I am truly grateful for their effort and professionalism.</p>
