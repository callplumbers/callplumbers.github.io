You, for that reason, have to use increasingly more detergent to achieve the very same cleaning power. The media gets a bath in the salt option. Tough minerals captured in the resin (or zeolite) are released and the media gets replenished with salt ions. The water softener is also cleaned and sanitized during regeneration. Finally, water including the difficult minerals and other waste gets eliminated of the system.</p>
