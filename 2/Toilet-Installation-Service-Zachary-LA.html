The repair may be as simple as changing a few rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or might need the replacement of a few of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester carries out a field test, he generates information on the functions of the assembly.  It ends up being the tester's task to know what the field test data indicates for that particular assembly.  When a trained tester interprets the information, he can identify what parts of the backflow prevention assembly failed the test and requires repair.</p>
