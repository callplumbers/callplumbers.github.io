<p>Backflow is a possible problem in a water system due to the fact that it can spread out contaminated water back through a circulation system. For instance, backflow at unrestrained cross connections (cross-connections are any possible or real connection in between the general public supply of water and a source of contamination or pollution) can allow contaminants or pollutants to enter the drinkable water supply. Illness can arise from ingesting water that has been contaminated due to backflow.</p>
<p>Organic debris, such as food, hair, or grease stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is typically the reason for clogged drains. The most typical way a plumber unclogs P-traps is with a tool referred to as a plumber's drain, cable or snake auger. The tool is carefully inserted down your drain to clear it of accumulation. You can attempt to do this yourself, however this isn't a beginner's DIY project. If you utilize the tool improperly, you can damage your pipes and trigger other leakages - so it's worth it to call somebody who understands the drill.</p>
