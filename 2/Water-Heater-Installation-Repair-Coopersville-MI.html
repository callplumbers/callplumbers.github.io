Oxidants such as chlorine in the public water system react with the polybutylene piping and acetal fittings, triggering them to scale, flake, and become fragile. This results in micro-fractures and minimizes the basic structural integrity of the system.

Incorrect installation is also a common cause of polybutylene system failure, which can be almost impossible to identify.</p>
