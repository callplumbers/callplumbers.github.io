<h3>Sewer and Drain Cleaning Tips in Manorville NY 11949</h3>

Points at which a safe and clean water supply gets in touch with a non-potable water supply are called cross connections. Such connections happen naturally in home appliances such as clothes washers and dishwashers, however they should be carefully designed and set up to prevent backflow. Another common place for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water main, to avoid pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the public supply of water.</p>
