<p>Your kitchen sink is an integral part of your home, that makes its plumbing's efficient functioning a need more than a need. As soon as the test results show the repair is total, it is time to re-pressurize the plumbing system that was separated throughout the repair process. It is essential that the plumbing system be switched on extremely gradually to guarantee no damage is done to the piping system. When the system is pressurized, air needs to be eliminated from the plumbing system. Each outlet on the plumbing system need to be checked to ensure no valves were accidentally left open or did not close correctly when re-pressurized. As soon as the plumbing system is pressurized, be sure all valves are completely open and inform the water user that the plumbing system has been gone back to service.</p>

When the control valve registers the softening capability of the resin is decreasing, the heavy brine solution is extracted of the tank and flushed through the resin in the mineral tank. If the brine tank runs out of salt, the water going through the system will no longer be softened.</p>
