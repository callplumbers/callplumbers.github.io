<p>A total repipe of a home's water supply, frequently done to replace leaking polybutylene pipes, is the most costly and complex plumbing job, says Steven Wood, president of Flo-Right Services, a plumbing company focusing on entire home repiping.

Since of the age of the home and location of the pipe, it was a tough task. They worked for nearly 12 hours into darkness to make certain the system was working prior to they left. I am really grateful for their hard work and professionalism.</p>
