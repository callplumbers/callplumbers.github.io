<p>To figure out if your home is a poly home," begin with the exterior. Underground water mains are normally blue in color (they can also be black or gray). The pipe is normally 1/2 to 1-inch in size. Regularly, it goes into the house near the hot water heater. Your main turned off is connected to the end of the water pipe.

The most typical washers are often readily available in your home centers and hardware shops. Other designs can be hard to find. Remove it and take it to the shop to find a match if you choose to hunt for a washer. Plumbers normally replace the whole fill valve instead of hunt for a replacement washer.</p>
