Solder on any nipples and fittings prior to linking the unit to the bypass valve to avoid melting the plastic if you are using copper pipes. Seal all threads with plumber's tape.

Though it might need additional adapters, flexible tubing is far easier to deal with and can make use of push-to-connect fittings, saving you time and the trouble of soldering.</p>
