Points at which a safe and clean water system gets in touch with a non-potable water system are called cross connections. Such connections happen naturally in home appliances such as clothes washers and dishwashers, but they must be thoroughly designed and set up to prevent backflow. Another common area for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water pipe, to prevent pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the general public water supply.</p>
