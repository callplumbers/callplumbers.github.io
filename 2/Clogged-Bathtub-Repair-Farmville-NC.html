Residences integrated in the first part of the 1900s were plumbed utilizing lead pipes.

<p>A cross-connection is any irreversible or short-lived connection between a public water system or customer's potable (i.e., drinking) water system and any source or system consisting of nonpotable water or other compounds. An example is the piping between a public water system or customer's potable water supply and an auxiliary water system, cooling system or irrigation system.</p>
<p>Sometimes, an untrained person will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the presumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair might be as easy as replacing a few rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or might require the replacement of a few of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester performs a field test, he creates information on the operations of the assembly.  It becomes the tester's duty to understand what the field test information implies for that specific assembly.  When a trained tester translates the data, he can determine what parts of the backflow prevention assembly failed the test and needs repair.</p>
