It was installed 7 years back, and it never drained this well. I picked this company since they had fantastic evaluations and a fair price, and although the job took a lot more time and work than they anticipated it to, they honored their quote. I will utilize Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing needs in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were monsters. They had a huge, revolting mess on their hands (actually), and they did a terrific job tidying up after it too.</p>
