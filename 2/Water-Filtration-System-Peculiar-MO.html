<p>Another typical argument versus the need for backflow preventers is that if all the valves are closed the water can't go backwards through them, so the valves need to avoid backflow.  The obvious problem with this is that if the backflow occurs at a time when the valve is open, like when the sprinklers are on, the valve will not stop backflow!  What if the valve is closed?  A basic manually run valve needs to stop backflow when it is closed - if the valve if fully closed, has excellent seals, and does not leak.  Nevertheless the majority of the automatic valves, such as the electrical solenoid valves used for watering systems, will not stop backflow even when off" and completely closed.</p>
<p>To make it basic, house owners with testable backflow devices are expected to have them evaluated by a certified tester each year. The most typical testable backflow device discovered at Minnesota houses is a pressure vacuum breaker, which is a device that is found on nearly every residential yard irrigation system (aka sprinkler system), shown listed below.</p>
