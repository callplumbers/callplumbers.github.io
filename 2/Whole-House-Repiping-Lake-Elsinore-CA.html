<p>When the pressure in the system is greater than the pressure of the inbound drinkable water supply, backpressure backflow in a building results. Backpressure can be brought on by pumps or temperature increases in boilers, or if there is a decrease in the supply of water pressure. Backsiphonage occurs when negative or lower pressure develops in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, usually due to an interruption or drain in the supply, such as water main repairs or breaks, or neighboring firefighting activity. To prevent backflow, a backflow preventer device is installed on each main water service line-- domestic and fire water-- feeding the building. A common type of backflow preventer is the lowered pressured zone (RPZ) assembly.</p>

<p>Using different metals in the plumbing can result in galvanic rust Direct contact in between different metals will initiate the development of a galvanic cell, which is created whenever 2 different types of metal are conductively linked to each other, and after that immersed in an electrolyte such as water. Within the galvanic cell, the more anodic metal will be rusted and an electrical current is produced because of the procedure. A common example of this is when galvanized pipe is directly linked to copper pipe. It is also worth noting that while utilizing a brass fitting to bridge the gap in between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it likewise will not completely prevent it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be used to reduce this direct contact between the dissimilar metals. A dielectric coupling consists of an insulating material that physically separates contact in between the two metals.</p>
