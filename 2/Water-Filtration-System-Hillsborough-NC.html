<h3>Emergency Plumbing Service Hillsborough NC</h3>
<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow triggered by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or consumer's drinkable water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the drinkable water system pressure) can result from an increase in downstream pressure, a reduction in the potable water supply pressure, or a mix of both. Pumps can create boosts in downstream pressure; temperature boosts in boilers, and so on. Reductions in potable supply of water pressure happen whenever the amount of water being utilized surpasses the amount of water being provided, such as throughout water line flushing, fire fighting, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
