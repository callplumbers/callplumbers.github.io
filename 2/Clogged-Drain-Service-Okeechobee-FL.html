<p>Another common argument against the need for backflow preventers is that if all the valves are closed the water can't go backwards through them, so the valves must avoid backflow.  The obvious issue with this is that if the backflow takes place at a time when the valve is open, like when the sprinklers are on, the valve will not stop backflow!  What if the valve is closed?  A standard manually operated valve should stop backflow when it is closed - if the valve if fully closed, has great seals, and does not leak.  However most of the automated valves, such as the electric solenoid valves utilized for irrigation systems, will not stop backflow even when off" and fully closed.</p>
