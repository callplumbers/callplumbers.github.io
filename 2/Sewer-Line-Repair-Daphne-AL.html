<p>The next criteria to assess is how the backflow prevention assembly is set up. It is essential that the repair technician knows the correct installation orientation and can evaluate the installation conditions to guarantee there are no conditions circumventing the working of the assembly. The backflow prevention assembly must be set up in the installation orientation for which it was authorized. Most backflow preventers are set up in a horizontal orientation to the surrounding grade. Some (not all) backflow preventers can be installed in a vertical orientation, but it is important that the assembly only be installed if it is approved for that orientation. To arbitrarily take an RP and stand it on its end in a vertical orientation may cause the backflow prevention assembly to not work properly and no matter how many parts you put inside the assembly, it still may not work because the installation orientation is causing the failure.</p>
<p>Considering that 1980, backflow preventers have been legally mandated for particular structures by the New York Sanitary Code and the Rules of the City of New York City. The policy was not strictly enforced till a push in recent years by the DEP's Cross-Connection Control Program, an initiative that consists of routine random inspections of New York City buildings to make sure they are in compliance.</p>
