<p>Backpressure backflow is triggered by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or customer's safe and clean water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the drinkable water system pressure) can result from a boost in downstream pressure, a decrease in the safe and clean supply of water pressure, or a mix of both. Increases in downstream pressure can be developed by pumps, temperature level increases in boilers, etc. Decreases in safe and clean water supply pressure take place whenever the amount of water being used exceeds the quantity of water being supplied, such as throughout water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
<p>Today's high-efficiency softeners are changing the economics of water softening in the carwash industry.
