<p>Backsiphonage can occur when there is an abrupt reduction in the water pressure of the circulation system, such as during fire fighting or when a water main breaks. At these occurances, water circulation can be reversed. This turnaround can create a suction effect and draw possible impurities into the safe and clean (drinking) water system. Tank water heaters are typically found in most homes. Their elements are an insulated tank, usually holding 30-50 gallons of water, to heat and shop the water until it's required.
