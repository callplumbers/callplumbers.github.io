<p>Your kitchen sink is an important part of your house, that makes its plumbing's efficient functioning a necessity more than a need. As soon as the test results show the repair is total, it is time to re-pressurize the plumbing system that was isolated throughout the repair process.

Once the system is pressurized, air must be gotten rid of from the plumbing system. When re-pressurized, each outlet on the plumbing system need to be examined to guarantee no valves were accidentally left open or did not close effectively. Once the plumbing system is pressurized, be sure all valves are entirely open and alert the water user that the plumbing system has been returned to service.</p>
