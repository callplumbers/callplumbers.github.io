<p>Once the hardware parts have actually been cleaned up and examined and the rubber parts have actually been changed, now reassemble the parts back into their components. Some components may have extremely tight tolerances that have to be maintained. A crucial thing to determine on each element is the guide. The guide is the part that directs or steadies the movement of the element. The guide is a really vital part of the style of each component. If the part is not repaired properly, the guide could limit the motion (rather than direct or constant) of the component, which might cause the part to not work to its capabilities. Lot of times springs are erroneously blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. In many cases the guides are restricting the travel of the part causing lower test results than what is needed.</p>
