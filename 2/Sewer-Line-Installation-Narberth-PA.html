<p>The pipe-bursting approach is utilized on pipes that are significantly harmed, for changing a whole pipe system, or for repairing bigger areas of sewer pipeline The installers need physical access to the pipe in order to start repair, which includes 2 4 foot square access pits at either end of the pipeline. The installers begin by positioning a "bursting head" at the gain access to point on one end of the pipe. Hydraulic power is used to drag the head through the pipe. As it makes its method through the system, breaking the old pipe apart and drawing in a new seamless pipe behind it. The pipe is a plastic product that will be invulnerable to root invasion for as much as 100 years.</p>
