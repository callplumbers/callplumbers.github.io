<p>A reduced pressure zone backflow device (RPZ) is a testable kind of backflow prevention device that is set up in high risk" applications. The RPZ resembles the DC. It has two spring checks, however also has a 3rd check valve that is in fact a vent open up to environment on the bottom of the valve (kept closed by the water pressure). The reason it is used in high-risk circumstances is since if the very first check valve ever breakdowns, the bottom of the valve then drains and opens.

<p>Another typical argument versus the need for backflow preventers is that if all the valves are closed the water can't go backwards through them, so the valves must prevent backflow.  The obvious problem with this is that if the backflow occurs at a time when the valve is open, like when the sprinklers are on, the valve will not stop backflow!  What if the valve is closed?  A standard by hand run valve must stop backflow when it is closed - if the valve if completely closed, has great seals, and does not leak.  However the majority of the automatic valves, such as the electrical solenoid valves utilized for watering systems, will not stop backflow even when off" and totally closed.</p>
<p>Storm drains are an integral part in an advanced system that has been designed and crafted to take all of the floodwaters and run off from rainstorms and channel it securely into the cities drainage systems. Without storm drains we 'd have to deal with flooded areas often during bouts of severe rain.
