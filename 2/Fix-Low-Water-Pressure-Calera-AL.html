Instead, our technicians utilize a breaking tool that requires the existing pipeline to burst" and disintegrate.

This repair technique is usually used to replace the old pipe with a similar or larger pipe.</p>

Easements (usually 10 feet large) where main sewers pass through private property are an exception to this rule.</p>
