<p>Aside from these two essential components, there are a myriad of little, perhaps less important things that can break or degrade. For instance, if you lose your toilet bowl bolt covers (those little caps on the base of the toilet), the bolts holding your toilet to the floor will corrode much more quickly. Continuous gross smells originating from the toilet can suggest you need a new wax ring where your toilet attaches to the floor drain. If the float rod of your fill valve isn't lifting appropriately, you may need a brand-new cap for the fill valve. Bulges in the supply line can burst and cause a leak. If mishandled, tank lids can split and leave your toilet's inner functions exposed. While this won't impact the function of your toilet, it definitely does not do much for the visual of your bathroom. We're not attempting to psych you out by mentioning all the important things that can fail, the point is - your toilet is a total fixture and every part requires to be in good shape for it to operate at its best.</p>
