<p>Before the repair professional begins the repair procedure, he should make sure he has actually examined the workspace around the backflow prevention assembly in order to determine any limiting conditions. If the area is thought about a restricted area, appropriate safety precautions must be followed for appropriate entry. A correct and safe  work environment might entail the positioning of security barriers or entry constraints around the workspace so the repair service technician or the public around your work area are not damaged. This might affect the service technician's ability to successfully finish the repair if the backflow preventer is installed in a restrictive area.</p>
