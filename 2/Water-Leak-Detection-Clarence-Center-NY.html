It was installed 7 years ago, and it never drained this well. I picked this company since they had great evaluations and a fair rate, and even though the task took a lot more time and work than they anticipated it to, they honored their quote. I will utilize Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing needs in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were monsters. They had a huge, horrible mess on their hands (literally), and they did a fantastic task tidying up after it too.</p>
