Cooking oil and other greases should never ever be put down the waste disposal unit due to the fact that they can impede the blades. Lastly, cold water needs to be running when the garbage disposal is on and need to continue to run for 30 seconds after the disposal is turned off to guarantee that all food particles have been washed through the pipes.</p>
<p>In the meantime, nevertheless, we suggest you first try using non-abrasive and non-harsh white vinegar and lemon juice with baking soda. Merely put a cup of baking soda into your toilet bowl, add some white vinegar and lemon juice, and let the mixture sit for a while. If that doesn't work, you can try a non-abrasive toilet bowl cleaner. A lot of these cleaners include concentrated levels of hydrocloric acid, which can be really damaging if it can be found in contact with skin, eyes, or lungs.
