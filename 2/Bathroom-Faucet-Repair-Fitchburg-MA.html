<p>The source or place of a sewer issue determines who pays for repair. The City is responsible for the public right-of-way (curb to curb), from one side of the street to another. The property owner is responsible for the area from the curb to the back of their property line. Easements (typically 10 feet wide) where main drains traverse personal property are an exception to this guideline.</p>
<p>Before our professional technicians can start applying their abilities and experience, we initially need to ensure that the line is correctly cleaned and prepared for our repair. Our repair processes count on having a clean, smooth pipeline, otherwise, flaws triggered by waste buildup can prevent the liner from adhering to the walls effectively. We clean the sewer lines with hydro jetting, a service that enables a comprehensive cleaning by blasting streams of hot, pressurized water directly into the line. The special nozzle connected to the hose directs the water in all instructions to allow the water to cover the whole size of the sewer line and offer a cautious cleaning.</p>
