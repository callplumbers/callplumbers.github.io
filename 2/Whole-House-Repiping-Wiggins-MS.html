<h3>Tips For Finding A Cheap Plumber Wiggins MS</h3>
<p>In water distribution systems, water is normally maintained at a considerable pressure to enable water to flow from the tap, shower, or other fixture. Water pressure may stop working or be reduced when a water main bursts, pipes freeze, or there is suddenly high demand on the water system (for instance, when several fire hydrants are opened). Reduced pressure in the pipe may permit contaminated water from the soil, from storage, or from other sources to be drawn up into the system.</p>
