<p>Often, an untrained person will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the presumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair may be as basic as changing a few rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or may need the replacement of a few of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester performs a field test, he creates information on the workings of the assembly.  It becomes the tester's responsibility to know what the field test information suggests for that particular assembly.  When a qualified tester translates the information, he can identify what parts of the backflow prevention assembly failed the test and requires repair.</p>
