<p>To determine if your house is a poly house," start with the outside. Underground water mains are typically blue in color (they can also be black or gray). The pipe is usually 1/2 to 1-inch in diameter. Frequently, it gets in the house near the hot water heater. Your main shut down is connected to completion of the water main. Ensure you examine both ends of the pipe. We have actually found cases where the copper pipe goes into the home and polybutylene is at the meter.</p>
