<p>Your old discharge tube most likely will not be the ideal length for your brand-new disposal. If it's too long, just connect it to the disposal, mark it and cut it with a hacksaw for your waste disposal unit installation. (Loosen the other pipe connections, if necessary, to place television back into the tee.) You might have to make a time-wasting trip to the store if the old discharge tube is too short. To prevent this, ensure the new garbage disposal installation set consists of a tube, or purchase one independently at the same time for about $3.</p>
