<p>Food scraps compose approximately 20% of all household waste. If it can quickly and quickly be disposed of through the sink, this big quantity of garbage does not need to go in the garbage can. A garbage disposal works by shredding the waste into tiny pieces that are capable of taking a trip through the sewage pipes without hindering water circulation. By setting up a waste disposal unit you are helping the environment by saving the amount of trash that gets sent out to land fills and other discarding locations. With a waste disposal unit the trash is handled through currently existing water facilities.</p>
