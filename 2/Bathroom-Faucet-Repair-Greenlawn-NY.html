It has two spring checks, but also has a third check valve that is actually a vent open to environment on the bottom of the valve (kept closed by the water pressure). The reason it is utilized in high-risk scenarios is due to the fact that if the very first check valve ever malfunctions, the bottom of the valve then drains and opens.
