<p>Letters are sent out to residential customers with known backflow devices on an annual basis. The City's plumbing code requires a backflow preventer on all landscape watering systems, pool, and hot tubs. Turn the disposal system to line up the discharge tailpiece with the drain trap, and after that link it. Relying on the existing trap configuration, you might need to replace some or all of the drain piping underneath the sink to accommodate the disposal.</p>
<p>The source or place of a sewer problem determines who spends for repair. The City is accountable for the general public right-of-way (curb to suppress), from one side of the street to another.

Based on the condition of the line, it might be an appropriate choice to do simply that. However, if the offset worsens trenchless might no longer be an option.</p>
