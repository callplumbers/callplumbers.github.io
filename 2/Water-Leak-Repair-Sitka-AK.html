<p>If you don't have a plumber's snake, you can utilize a wire coat hanger by aligning it. Of course, it will not reach as far as a plumber's snake would, but it might be long enough to reach some blockages. If you can reach it, place it into the kitchen drain or stub pipe to push through or pull out the clog. Beware not to scratch your sink with the wire.</p>
