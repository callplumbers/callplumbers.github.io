However, there are numerous drawbacks to utilizing these dangerous items - not least of which is that they generally contain substances such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by liquifying whatever is triggering a clog, which can vary from the normal suspects like hair or food to mineral accumulation, small objects, dirt, and even roots in cases where broken pipes on your home draw the attention of plant life.
