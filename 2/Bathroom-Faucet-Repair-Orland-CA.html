<p>Carefully lift the rod and listen if your flapper valve has a ball that floats at the end of a rod. If the water turns off, you might be able to stop the running by changing the float. Some fill toilet valves have a float adjustment screw on top (see Figure A listed below). If there is no adjustment screw, flex the float arm. Make sure it's changed appropriately (Image 8)if you have a Fluidmaster-style fill valve. You don't have to empty the tank to make these modifications.</p>
<p>Drawbacks to be aware of is that hybrid water heaters need to be installed in an area that remains between 40 to 90 degrees, or they will not work well.

Also, hybrids require up to 1,000 cubic feet of uncooled space to catch enough heat from the air, and a drain in close distance to release the condensate.</p>
