<p>A lowered pressure zone backflow device (RPZ) is a testable type of backflow prevention device that is installed in high danger" applications. The RPZ is similar to the DC. It has 2 spring checks, but also has a third check valve that is really a vent available to atmosphere on the bottom of the valve (kept closed by the water pressure). The factor it is utilized in high-risk scenarios is due to the fact that if the first check valve ever malfunctions, the bottom of the valve then drains and opens. This relief valve uses an extra layer of protection compared to the DC, which will allow backflow if both check valves breakdown. This is the reason that when you evaluate an RPZ, you force water to backflow to make sure the RPZ discharges.</p>

<p>Remodeling plumbers generally charge a minimum of $45 to $65 per hour for one man and a truck. Again, this doesn't include the cost of parts. But more and more plumbers are charging "by the component," and their quotes are based upon the rough-in for drain and supply lines ($ 300 to $400 in my area) and installation of the components themselves (about $200).
