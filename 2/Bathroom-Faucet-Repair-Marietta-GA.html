<p>As soon as the hardware parts have actually been cleaned and examined and the rubber parts have been replaced, now reassemble the parts back into their parts. Some elements might have really tight tolerances that need to be preserved. A crucial thing to identify on each element is the guide. The guide is the part that directs or steadies the movement of the element. The guide is a very vital part of the design of each element. If the element is not repaired correctly, the guide might restrict the motion (rather than direct or constant) of the element, which might cause the element to not work to its capabilities. Sometimes springs are erroneously blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. Most of the times the guides are restricting the travel of the element causing lower test results than what is needed.</p>
