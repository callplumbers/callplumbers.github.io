<p>Sewer linings can help to repair split pipes without needing to completely replace your sewer lines or destroy the area around them. Because it is a big task that is typically perceived as an unnecessary cost, many house owners prevent repiping their homes. Why repipe your house when fixing it is possible? Well, the fact is that repiping is more cost-efficient and effective oftentimes.

This is also not as reliable because the drain machine loses torque the further you are far from the clog.
