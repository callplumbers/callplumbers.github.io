Finally, a quality contractor will not danger dealing with a substandard plumber. A simple error-- a joint left unsoldered or a leaky PVC line-- can quickly devastate $10,000 worth of walls or wood floorings and complicate the job with insurance claims, wasted time, and suits. With so much riding on the plumber, contractors tend to stick to only the best.</p>
