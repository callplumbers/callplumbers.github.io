<h3>How to Ensure Drain Cleaning Services Are Performed Correctly in Groton CT 06340</h3>
<p>Backflow suggests the unfavorable reversal of circulation of a liquid, gas, or suspended solid into the safe and clean supply of water; a backflow preventer is created to keep this from occurring. Points at which a drinkable water system connects with a non-potable water supply are called cross connections. Such connections happen naturally in home appliances such as clothes washers and dishwashers, but they should be carefully developed and installed to avoid backflow. Another common location for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water pipe, to prevent pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the public supply of water.</p>
