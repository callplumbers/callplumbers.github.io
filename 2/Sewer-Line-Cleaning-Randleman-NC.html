<p>Galvanized steel drinkable water system and distribution pipes are commonly discovered with nominal pipe sizes from 3⁄8 inch (9.5 mm) to 2 inches (51 mm). It is hardly ever used today for new building and construction residential plumbing. Steel pipe has National Pipe Thread (NPT) standard tapered male threads, which connect with female tapered threads on elbows, tees, couplers, valves, and other fittings. Galvanized steel (often known merely as "galv" or "iron" in the plumbing trade) is relatively costly, and challenging to deal with due to weight and requirement of a pipe threader It stays in common use for repair of existing "galv" systems and to please building code non-combustibility requirements normally found in hotels, apartment buildings and other commercial applications.
