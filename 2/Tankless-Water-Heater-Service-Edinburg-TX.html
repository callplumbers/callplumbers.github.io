<p>To identify if your home is a poly house," start with the outside. Underground water mains are normally blue in color (they can likewise be gray or black). The pipe is generally 1/2 to 1-inch in diameter. Regularly, it goes into the house near the hot water heater. Your main shut down is connected to completion of the water main. Ensure you inspect both ends of the pipe. We have found cases where the copper pipe goes into the house and polybutylene is at the meter.</p>
