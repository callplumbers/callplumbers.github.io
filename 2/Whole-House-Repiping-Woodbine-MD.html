<p>Once the hardware parts have actually been cleaned up and examined and the rubber parts have actually been changed, now reassemble the parts back into their parts.

The guide is a very vital part of the design of each part. If the component is not repaired effectively, the guide could restrict the motion (rather than direct or consistent) of the element, which might trigger the component to not work to its capabilities.

Most of the times the guides are limiting the travel of the component triggering lower test outcomes than what is needed.</p>
