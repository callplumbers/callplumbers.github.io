<p>Once the hardware parts have actually been cleaned up and examined and the rubber parts have actually been changed, now reassemble the parts back into their parts. Some parts might have extremely tight tolerances that have to be kept. An important thing to identify on each part is the guide. The guide is the part that directs or steadies the motion of the part. The guide is a very vital part of the design of each part. If the component is not repaired effectively, the guide could restrict the motion (rather than direct or consistent) of the element, which might trigger the component to not work to its capabilities. Often times springs are erroneously blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. Most of the times the guides are limiting the travel of the component triggering lower test outcomes than what is needed.</p>
