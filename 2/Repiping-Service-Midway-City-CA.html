<p>Examining the age, water, and condition lines to the water heater can help plumbers understand lots of things, including water pressure and signs of leaks. If the water heater has actually been preserved with annual flush service, it can likely last beyond its basic guarantee.

<p>Deluge systems are designed so that all the sprinkler heads are open and the piping is not pressurized. These systems usually are installed in locations where the possibility of a severe fire condition is likely, such as airplane hangars.
