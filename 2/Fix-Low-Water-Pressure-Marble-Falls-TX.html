<p>Backpressure backflow is triggered by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or consumer's safe and clean water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the drinkable supply of water pressure) can arise from a boost in downstream pressure, a reduction in the potable water system pressure, or a combination of both. Increases in downstream pressure can be created by pumps, temperature level increases in boilers, and so on. Reductions in drinkable water system pressure occur whenever the amount of water being used goes beyond the amount of water being provided, such as during water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
