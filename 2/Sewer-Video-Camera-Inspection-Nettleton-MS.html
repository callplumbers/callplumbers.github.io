<p>Your sewer line carries wastewater away from the sinks, toilets, and showers of your house. A damaged gas line is a really major concern, and often an issue will develop at the most bothersome times. Sadly, not all plumbing specialists will accept service calls after hours, leaving property owners disappointed and not sure what to do. At Mr. Rooter Plumbing of Pittsburgh, we make sure that our clients are pleased and safe at all times. That's why we offer 24 hour emergency services for local Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania area house and company owner. If you encounter a last minute problem, call our workplace anytime and we will send a rescue team to your location immediately, 24 hr a day, 7 days a week.</p>
<p>High water pressure also harms plumbing. The water entering into the house puts excess pressure on faucet seal, water shut off valves and supply lines, and toilets. High water pressure leads to leaks, running toilets and other plumbing problems that will continue to happen without correct pressure reduction. You can also minimize salt, water, and energy by utilizing up to 50% less detergent for laundry and dish-washing, using up to 34% less salt and approximately 35% less water during regeneration.</p>
