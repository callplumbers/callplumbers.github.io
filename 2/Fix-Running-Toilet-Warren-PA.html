<h2>Tips To Hire Emergency Plumbing Contractor in Warren</h2>
<p><img src="https://plumbingimages.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/plumbing.jpg" alt=""><p>
<p>Kcb plumbing contractors, Inc The majority of the homes in our area were constructed before 1965, which is the time when copper piping for hot and cold water ended up being basic. Older houses were installed with galvanized iron cut and thread pipe. Iron that comes in contact with water and oxygen will wear away. This rust, or rust, triggers the iron to swell up and become flaky. In order to prevent the rusting of the iron, the pipes were dipped in zinc. The zinc bonds with the iron and develops a waterproof membrane to safeguard the iron from rusting.</p>
<p>The person who does the testing should be a certified backflow tester. Not all licensed plumbers have this accreditation, and a plumbing license is not required to acquire this accreditation. I have actually contacted a couple of plumbers, and the prices quoted for backflow testing varied from $150 - $250, but I would expect the cost to be substantially less from backflow testers who are not licensed plumbers.</p>
