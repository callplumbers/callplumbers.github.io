<p>There are a number of things that can go wrong with your sewer line. Like all pipes, the sewer line will not last permanently. It has remained in place considering that your home was developed so it has to do with the exact same age as your home. There are some things that can harm a sewer pipe such as freeze and thaw cycles and deterioration. Blunt force can break a pipe, such as when construction is being done at or near your house.</p>
