<p>Backflow is bad news. The severe water conditions in Orlando and Central Florida are tough on pipes. Over an amount of time the within lining of the pipe will degrade and a small pinhole leak will develop. In some cases the solution is to repair the broken area of pipe, and an area repair is all that is necessary to resolve the concern. Other times a more comprehensive service is needed: repiping.</p>
<p>City of Bellingham checks backflow assemblies upon installation and carries out periodic re-inspections on all existing assemblies. New assemblies should be tested by a State of Washington certified Backflow Assembly Tester prior to putting into service. A copy of the test report must be offered to the City of Bellingham.

<p>House water softeners, likewise called ion exchange systems, are appliances that remove calcium, magnesium, and other minerals from drinking water. Resin beads inside the softener trap the calcium and magnesium and exchange them for sodium or potassium. Once the resin beads become loaded with calcium and magnesium, a highly-concentrated salt or potassium service removes the calcium and magnesium from the beads. After passing through the beads, the resulting chloride option becomes a waste stream that decreases the drain and ultimately into the environment.</p>
