<p>A decreased pressure zone backflow device (RPZ) is a testable kind of backflow prevention device that is installed in high danger" applications. The RPZ is similar to the DC. It has two spring checks, but also has a third check valve that is in fact a vent available to environment on the bottom of the valve (kept closed by the water pressure). The reason it is used in high-risk circumstances is since if the first check valve ever breakdowns, the bottom of the valve then drains and opens. This relief valve offers an extra layer of security compared to the DC, which will enable backflow if both check valves malfunction. This is the factor that when you check an RPZ, you require water to backflow to ensure the RPZ discharges.</p>
