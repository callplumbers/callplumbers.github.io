<p>Your storm drains do not go directly into the ground and into oblivion either, this water is typically carried elsewhere to a neighboring treatment plant, a creek, or perhaps the ocean in. Through the storm drain system there are long, flat sections of pipe that can be susceptible to clogging since there just isn't enough a high enough circulation to eliminate the debris.</p>

<p>When pressure in a water system goes beyond the pressure in the safe and clean system providing the make-up water, backpressure is developed. This can force the safe and clean water to reverse its direction of circulation through the cross-connection between the 2 systems. Prospective impurities can then go into the potable water system. The very best way to reduce build-up is have a professional flush it at least once a year. In some locations of Virginia, where the water is particularly tough with high mineral material, you might need to flush the hot water heater more frequently.</p>
