<p>In this scenario, dirty water from the hillside swimming pool will back- siphon or back-flow down the hosepipe and into the clean water tank. You also need to buy a backflow valve if you observe your water has an uncommon flow, odor, taste or color. A plumbing professional can figure out whether the issue with your faucet is a quick fix or the result of other issues in your home's plumbing system.
