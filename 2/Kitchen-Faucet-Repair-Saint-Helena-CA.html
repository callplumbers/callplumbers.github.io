<p>Tankless Hot water heater - provide warm water as needed without a tank.

Cooking oil and other greases must never be put down the garbage disposal because they can hamper the blades. Finally, cold water should be running when the garbage disposal is on and ought to continue to run for 30 seconds after the disposal is shut off to ensure that all food particles have been washed through the pipes.</p>
<p>We concentrate on repair, service and installation of all makes and models of gas hot water heater, electric water heaters and tankless hot water heater.
