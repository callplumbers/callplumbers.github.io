<h3>Everything You Ever Wanted To Know About Plumbers Glen Rose TX</h3>
<p>Broken sewer pipes can be more than simply a costly repair-- they can result in substantial and costly residential or commercial property damage and result in severe health threats. Sewer line repair is the very first line of defense when a sewer line fails. If the sewer line can't be fixed, sewer line replacement is the only other choice. Thankfully, Mr. Rooter Â® Plumbing is your local source for quality sewer repair and replacement at any time.</p>
<p>Hydro jetting is a procedure in which the sewer pipes are scrubbed clean by streams of high-pressure water shooting from a hose at as much as 3,500 PSI. This allows the sewer lines to be cleaned quickly and efficiently with high-velocity water pressure. The streams of high-pressure water, discharging from the reverse and forward jets in the nozzle, propel the hose through the line to eliminate particles such as tough water scale, sand, silt, and grease deposits.</p>
