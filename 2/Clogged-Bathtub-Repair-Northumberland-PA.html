<p>The person who does the testing must be a certified backflow tester. Not all licensed plumbers have this accreditation, and a plumbing license is not required to acquire this accreditation. I have actually consulted a few plumbers, and the estimate for backflow testing varied from $150 - $250, but I would expect the cost to be considerably less from backflow testers who are not licensed plumbers.</p>
