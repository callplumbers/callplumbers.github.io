<p>If the problems occurs well outside that 8 to 12 year life-span, a guideline of thumb is that you can recapture the cost of the repair. If, say, you need a brand-new burner package and the hot water heater is 5 years old, then it makes sense for you to invest the $120 for the part, particularly if you can do the work yourself. The closer the device is to that 8 to 12-year limitation, the more uncertain the economics of a repair ends up being. The factor is that some other part on the home appliance will go or its tank will leak. And there's no cure for a leaking tank.</p>
<p>House water softeners, also called ion exchange units, are home appliances that remove calcium, magnesium, and other minerals from drinking water. Resin beads inside the softener trap the calcium and magnesium and exchange them for salt or potassium. As soon as the resin beads end up being filled with calcium and magnesium, a highly-concentrated salt or potassium solution removes the calcium and magnesium from the beads. After passing through the beads, the resulting chloride solution becomes a waste stream that decreases the drain and eventually into the environment.</p>
