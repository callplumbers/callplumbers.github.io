<p>Viking SupplyNet's extensive stock of backflow valves and associated devices consists of leading products from Wilkins, Ames, Watts, and others. Oxidants such as chlorine in the general public water system react with the polybutylene piping and acetal fittings, triggering them to scale, flake, and become fragile. This results in micro-fractures and minimizes the standard structural stability of the system. The system becomes weak and might fail without caution, triggering damage to the building structure and personal effects. Improper installation is likewise a typical cause of polybutylene system failure, which can be almost difficult to find.</p>

<p>A partial reroute is essentially a small scale repiping of several afflicted locations of the plumbing beneath the slab. In cases where fixing the pipe and jackhammering are not cost efficient, it is possible to only desert the afflicted area of pipe and reroute the line through the ceilings, walls and attics. Costing less than a full repipe, completion result is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that might leak again in the future. We have experienced houses having 2 or more slab leaks within a 1-2 year duration, and these repairs can add up in cost very quickly. This is the main reason that we will suggest a complete repipe in specific neighborhoods, based on our experience.</p>
