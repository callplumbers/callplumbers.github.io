<p>Check the home's hot water heater You will be seeking to see if it is big enough to accommodate your requirements (a household of four should have at least a 40 gallon tank), where it lies, and the hot water heater's age.

Mineral deposits can decide on the tank's bottom, leaving less room for water - which will suggest that less water will be warmed and offered for use.
