<p>Backflow is the unfavorable reversal of circulation in a safe and clean water circulation system. Water that is always under pressure can just flow in one direction. Then how can water flow in reverse? Water will always stream towards the point of least expensive pressure. If a water main were to break or if the fire department opened several fire hydrants to help fight a fire, the pressure in the water pipe could drop. The need upstream might trigger a turnaround in circulation.</p>
<p>If your flapper valve has a ball that floats at the end of a rod, gently raise the rod and listen. If the water turns off, you might be able to stop the running by adjusting the float. Some fill toilet valves have a float modification screw on top (see Figure A below). Bend the float arm if there is no change screw. Make sure it's adjusted effectively (Photo 8)if you have a Fluidmaster-style fill valve. You don't have to empty the tank to make these changes.</p>
<p>In some households, using a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog might be the go-to approach when searching for a practical option, specifically when easy plunging doesn't appear to work. However, there are numerous drawbacks to utilizing these dangerous products - not least of which is that they generally consist of substances such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by dissolving whatever is triggering an obstruction, which can range from the normal suspects like hair or food to mineral accumulation, little objects, dirt, and even roots in cases where broken pipes on your home draw the attention of plant life. The strength of these chemicals makes them effective, however at the cost of presenting the threat of harm to your house and family.</p>
