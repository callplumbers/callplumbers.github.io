Such connections take place naturally in devices such as clothing washers and dishwashing machines, but they need to be thoroughly created and set up to avoid backflow. Another typical area for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water pipe, to avoid pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the general public water supply.</p>
