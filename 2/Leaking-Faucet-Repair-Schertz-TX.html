<p>Backflow implies the unwanted reversal of flow of a liquid, gas, or suspended strong into the safe and clean water supply; a backflow preventer is created to keep this from occurring. Points at which a potable water system connects with a non-potable water supply are called cross connections. Such connections take place naturally in home appliances such as clothing washers and dishwashing machines, but they must be carefully created and set up to prevent backflow. Another typical area for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water main, to avoid pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the public water system.</p>
