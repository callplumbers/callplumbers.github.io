And if your home was integrated in the 1970s or earlier, those pipes are most likely nearing the end of their life expectancy. As galvanized pipes age, they start to rust.

The repair may be as easy as replacing a couple of rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or may need the replacement of some of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester carries out a field test, he produces data on the functions of the assembly.  It becomes the tester's duty to understand what the field test data implies for that specific assembly.
