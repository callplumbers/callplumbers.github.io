Water pressure may be or stop working lowered when a water main bursts, pipes freeze, or there is all of a sudden high demand on the water system (for example, when numerous fire hydrants are opened). Decreased pressure in the pipe might allow contaminated water from the soil, from storage, or from other sources to be prepared into the system.</p>
<p>Backsiphonage can occur when there is a sudden decrease in the water pressure of the distribution system, such as during fire fighting or when a water pipe breaks. At these occurances, water flow can be reversed. This reversal can develop a suction result and draw prospective contaminants into the drinkable (drinking) water supply. Storage tank hot water heater are typically found in a lot of homes. Their parts are an insulated tank, generally holding 30-50 gallons of water, to heat and store the water up until it's needed.
