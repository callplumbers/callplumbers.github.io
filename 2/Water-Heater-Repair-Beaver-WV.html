<p>Echologics has a long history of establishing award-winning acoustic technologies for leak detection on buried water pipelines. Running a camera through the household sewer pipes (typically from your home to its connection to the general public sewer system) can be utilized to assess the type and condition of underground pipes, and to identify problems like leaking or broken joints, intruding roots, blockages, rust or collapsed pipes. House owners may have a video inspection done to find the cause of periodic sewer backups or other continuous problems, or when offering or buying an older house.</p>
<p>No hot water-- The absence of hot water is the greatest sign that there is something incorrect with your San Antonio water heater. If you aren't getting sufficient warm water for your shower, then you might have sediment that has built up in the unit and separated the water from the heat source.

<p>The salt water tank help the water softening system in regrowth. It is a shorter tank that sits surrounding to the mineral tank. The brine tank holds an extremely concentrated solution of salt (or sometimes potassium) to restore the resin beads' positive charge. Salt is manually contributed to the brine tank in the type of blocks or pellets. These dissolve in the water at the bottom of the tank. When the control valve registers the softening capability of the resin is diminishing, the heavy brine solution is drawn out of the tank and flushed through the resin in the mineral tank. The water passing through the system will no longer be softened if the brine tank runs out of salt.</p>
