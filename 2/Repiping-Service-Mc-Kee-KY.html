<p>Essential reminder: If you have a water softener and intend on not using it, remember to put the unit into bypass mode. 12. Verdonckt, C. and Nijs, C. (2007 ). In situ rust investigation on the impact of hard and softened water to domestic copper and galvanized steel drinking water supply." METALogic. Before you start the troubles of conventional pipe replacement, consider pipe lining. Repair damage from breaks, deterioration, and more, without having to replace the whole pipe.
