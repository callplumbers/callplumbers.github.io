How to tell if you have polybutylene pipes: If your pipes are white plastic and include the letters PB" in the printed label, you have polybutylene pipes and we recommend having them changed right away. Prior to you can ask for an inspection, you should first obtain the required license( s) for the work you intend to do. You can take a look at our Permit page for more details on obtaining an authorization. Once you obtain a license you can begin with the work. Nevertheless, you need to call for inspection before you conceal any work or cover.</p>
<p>Chelation: Another method is to introduce a chemical compound that serves as a chelating representative. Magnesium and calcium bind to this chelating representative and remain suspended in the water instead of developing on surface areas. However, if they stay in one location for long, as they may in a hot water heater, the accumulation could still occur.</p>
<p>For example, if your hot water heater is constantly breaking down and requiring repair, a brand-new unit will save you money. Furthermore, if you discover rising energy costs from an inefficient system, you will also save money with a new installation. We advise that all water heaters that are 10-15 years old be replaced in order to conserve the property owner money and time in the future.</p>
<p>We specialize in repair, service and installation of all makes and models of gas hot water heater, electric hot water heater and tankless hot water heater.
