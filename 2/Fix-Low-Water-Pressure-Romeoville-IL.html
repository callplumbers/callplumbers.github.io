<p>A. The toilet fill valve measurements we show are measured from the inside bottom of the tank to the top of the fill valve. The threaded supply of water shank that fits through the bottom of the tank is not consisted of in this measurement. The addition of a backflow preventer reduces water service pressure to the structure; extra, more considerable expenses can take place if the drop in water pressure ends up being an issue for residents. If setting up a pump or larger size water service and backflow prevention device would neutralize the pressure loss, a PE or RA can help figure out.</p>
<p>Sooner or later, however, the beads reach maximum capability and can't draw in any more mineral ions. At that point, the softener tank must be restored, or, flushed clean. That's where the salt water tank comes in. An on-board computer calculates the amount of water that flows through the softener. When it reaches the preprogrammed setting, regeneration immediately starts. For a three-bedroom house and household of four, regeneration usually takes place every 12,000 gallons.</p>
<p>According to the Epa, cross-connections can be a major public health threat if they do not have sufficient backflow prevention assemblies set up. There are numerous, well-documented cases in which cross-connections have actually been responsible for contamination of drinking water that, when taken in, triggered the spread of sickness or disease.</p>
