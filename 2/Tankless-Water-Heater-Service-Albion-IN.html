<h3>Trusted Home Plumbing Services Albion IN</h3>
<p>A backflow preventer stops water inside your water pipes from flowing back to the City system if pressure is lost. Backflow can infect the water system. The fundamental system for preventing backflow is a mechanical backflow prevention device, which provides a physical barrier to backflow. All leakages, broken fittings, and other plumbing problems will be resolved.</p>
<p>At any time the pressure on the home (downstream) side goes beyond the pressure on the city side, the two redundant check valves close-- avoiding any backflow. However, while DCV systems are considered safe for many fire security systems, they do have a flaw: if both valves fail or particles in the water line prevents them from closing entirely, backflow can happen.</p>
