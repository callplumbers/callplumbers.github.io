<p>An overall repipe of a home's water supply, frequently done to replace leaking polybutylene pipes, is the most detailed and expensive plumbing job, says Steven Wood, president of Flo-Right Services, a plumbing company specializing in whole home repiping. Recent Review: Carlos and Lopez were remarkable. My 90 years of age Daddy's sewer line clogged on Thanksgiving Day and Carlos reached 8am the next day to repair. Due to the fact that of the age of the house and location of the pipe, it was a challenging job. They worked for almost 12 hours into darkness to make certain the system was working before they left. I am really grateful for their effort and professionalism.</p>
