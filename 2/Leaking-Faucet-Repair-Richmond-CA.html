Water conditioners are gadgets that assist prevent the hardness-forming minerals from forming scale. They use a physical media to inhibit the scale from developing by reducing the effects of the hardness itself. Due to the truth that water conditioners utilize a physical media instead of a chemical media, they are often considered a greener option in areas where it is forbidden to utilize salt.
