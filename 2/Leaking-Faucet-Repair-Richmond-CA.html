Water conditioners are gadgets that assist prevent the hardness-forming minerals from forming scale. They use a physical media to inhibit the scale from developing by reducing the effects of the hardness itself. Due to the truth that water conditioners utilize a physical media instead of a chemical media, they are often considered a greener option in areas where it is forbidden to utilize salt. Water conditioners do not successfully eliminate firmness from the water supply, however, as the only method to do this is with a salt-based media.</p>
