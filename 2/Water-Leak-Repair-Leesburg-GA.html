<p>In water distribution systems, water is normally kept at a substantial pressure to make it possible for water to flow from the tap, shower, or other component. Water pressure might be or fail reduced when a water main bursts, pipes freeze, or there is unexpectedly high demand on the water system (for instance, when numerous fire hydrants are opened). Lowered pressure in the pipe may allow contaminated water from the soil, from storage, or from other sources to be prepared into the system.</p>
