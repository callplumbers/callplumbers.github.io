It truly isn't a good concept to utilize a toilet seat that is either much too big or much to small, unless they have actually been specifically developed to fit normal toilets, as the toilet seat can wobble and cause you to slide around, or won't disperse your weight equally and could eventually trigger cracks in the bowl.</p>
