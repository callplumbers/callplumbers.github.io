Chicago Gas Lines specializes in natural gas installation and repair for fireplaces, fire pits, grills, home appliances, heaters, generators & gas lights.

<p>Loose flanges are generally the outcome of wood rot. The flange screws simply won't keep in the soft, decayed subfloor. The best solution depends upon the degree of the rot.

Before you install this sort of ring, hold it up to the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You might need to cut off a number of ears to make it deal with your toilet. You'll have to replace a section of the subfloor if the rot extends well beyond the flange.</p>
