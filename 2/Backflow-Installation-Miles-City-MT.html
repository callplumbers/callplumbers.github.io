We advise organic items, such as Bio-Clean, because they work better than products consisting of severe chemicals and won't cause damage to your drains or fixtures.</p>

These crystals are tiny and flow typically through the water. Unlike with a softener that uses ion-exchange, this tank of resin beads does not require ongoing regrowth.</p>
<p>Typically triggered by slow seepage from the tank into the bowl. Put a couple of drops of food coloring in the tank. Wait an hour, then see and examine if you see coloring in the bowl. This shows a leaky flapper valve. Replacement is normally the fix. Alternatively, in some cases a faulty fill valve might actuate periodically, too. Water won't drain or is draining pipes slowly through the disposal.</p>
