It has 2 spring checks, but also has a 3rd check valve that is actually a vent open up to atmosphere on the bottom of the valve (kept closed by the water pressure). The reason it is utilized in high-risk situations is because if the first check valve ever malfunctions, the bottom of the valve then drains and opens.

This is the factor that when you test an RPZ, you require water to backflow to ensure the RPZ discharges.</p>
