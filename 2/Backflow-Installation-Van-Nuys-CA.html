<h2>Tips To Hire Professional Plumbing Contractors in Van Nuys</h2>

<p>Kcb plumbing contractors, Inc Most of the houses in our area were built before 1965, which is the time when copper piping for cold and hot water became standard. Older homes were set up with galvanized iron cut and thread pipe. Iron that comes in contact with water and oxygen will rust.

The zinc bonds with the iron and develops a water resistant membrane to secure the iron from rusting.</p>
