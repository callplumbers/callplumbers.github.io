<p>When to repair: Toilet obstructions are not unusual, but if your toilet is obstructing more than 3 times a month, there's a bigger issue to analyze. You may need to switch toilet paper or employ a plumber to clear an obstruction from the drain if your toilet is fairly brand-new. The National Contractor License Service keeps a list of each state's professional licensing firm where you can look up your state's licensing information. Examine the list of state licensing companies to discover whether a plumber is licensed in your state. Angie's List likewise keeps a licensing tool to check state licensing requirements.</p>
<p>In some households, utilizing a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog might be the go-to method when searching for a practical service, especially when simple plunging doesn't seem to work. However, there are numerous disadvantages to utilizing these harmful products - not least of which is that they normally contain substances such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by dissolving whatever is triggering an obstruction, which can vary from the normal suspects like hair or food to mineral buildup, little objects, dirt, and even roots in cases where broken pipes on your home draw the attention of plant life. The strength of these chemicals makes them effective, but at the cost of providing the threat of harm to your home and family.</p>
