<p>Water heater diagnostics: We determine what is incorrect with your water heater, in addition to what maintenance work requires to be carried out progressing. Water softeners typically use sodium (Na+) as the exchange ion. Sodium ions are provided from liquified sodium chloride salt, also called brine. In the ion exchange process, salt ions are used to coat an exchange medium in the softener The exchange medium can be natural zeolites" or artificial resin beads that resemble damp sand.</p>
<p>Clark's Process: This process is also called lime softening. The chemical calcium hydroxide, called limewater, is contributed to water, which triggers the solidity ions to speed up. The alkalinity of the water is raised through this addition to above 9.6, so co2 must be contributed to re-carbonate the water and bring the pH back down. When it concerns pipe repair, the most costly factors aren't the equipment or materials used, however the landscaping, uprooting and yard damage that takes place.</p>
