<p>A. Usually wax doesn't "go bad" on a standard floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to prevent leaks. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet is there to prevent smells. If you are experiencing a leak coming from beneath the floor-mounted toilet, you most likely have a partial (or complete blown) toilet stoppage down the drain line (or the toilet is split in the bowl). Likewise, make sure the leak isn't originating from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "normal" undetected issue. Try putting a few drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a few hours if you aren't sure where the leak is coming from.</p>

If our plumbers discover any problems with your system, the problem will be discussed to you and the proper repairs will be recommended.</p>
<p>It helps to understand the brand and design of your toilet. The brand name is normally on the bowl behind the seat.

Even professional plumbers often try 2 or 3 flappers before they discover one that works well.</p>
