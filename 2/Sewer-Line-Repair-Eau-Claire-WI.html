Most of toilets are basic sized - meaning a "will fit" seat suffices for security and comfort. Some toilets, however, have uniquely formed bowls and require a specific seat, like the Eljer Symbol. It really isn't an excellent idea to utilize a toilet seat that is either much too big or much to little, unless they have been specifically developed to fit regular toilets, as the toilet seat can wobble and cause you to slide around, or will not distribute your weight equally and could ultimately cause cracks in the bowl.</p>
