<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow caused by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or customer's drinkable water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the safe and clean supply of water pressure) can result from a boost in downstream pressure, a reduction in the safe and clean water system pressure, or a combination of both. Pumps can produce boosts in downstream pressure; temperature level increases in boilers, etc. Decreases in potable water system pressure take place whenever the quantity of water being utilized exceeds the quantity of water being provided, such as during water line flushing, fire battling, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
