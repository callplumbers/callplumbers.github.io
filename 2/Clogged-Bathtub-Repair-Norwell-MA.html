<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow brought on by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or consumer's potable water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the safe and clean water supply pressure) can result from a boost in downstream pressure, a decrease in the potable water system pressure, or a combination of both. Pumps can produce boosts in downstream pressure; temperature level increases in boilers, etc. Decreases in safe and clean water supply pressure happen whenever the amount of water being utilized goes beyond the quantity of water being provided, such as throughout water line flushing, fire combating, or breaks in water mains.</p>
