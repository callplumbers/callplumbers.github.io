<p>Backpressure backflow in a building results when the pressure in the system is greater than the pressure of the incoming safe and clean water system. Backpressure can be caused by pumps or temperature increases in boilers, or if there is a decline in the supply of water pressure. Backsiphonage takes place when unfavorable or decreased pressure establishes in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, typically due to a disturbance or drain in the supply, such as water pipe repairs or breaks, or close-by firefighting activity. To prevent backflow, a backflow preventer device is installed on each main water service line-- domestic and fire water-- feeding the building. A common type of backflow preventer is the lowered pressured zone (RPZ) assembly.</p>
