<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow triggered by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or customer's safe and clean water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the safe and clean water supply pressure) can result from an increase in downstream pressure, a decrease in the drinkable supply of water pressure, or a combination of both. Pumps can develop boosts in downstream pressure; temperature increases in boilers, etc. Reductions in safe and clean water system pressure take place whenever the amount of water being used surpasses the amount of water being provided, such as throughout water line flushing, fire fighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>
