<p>To determine if your home is a poly home," start with the exterior. Underground water mains are generally blue in color (they can also be black or gray). The pipe is normally 1/2 to 1-inch in diameter. Frequently, it gets in the house near the hot water heater. Your main shut down is attached to completion of the water pipe. Ensure you inspect both ends of the pipe. We have discovered cases where the copper pipe enters the home and polybutylene is at the meter.</p>
<p>Without a plumbing camera inspection, most drain problems can only be identified once they begin to back up. But, during routing plumbing inspections, a complete test of all drains will be performed. If something might be taking place behind the walls or in the ground, plumbers can attempt to recreate problems to determine. Professional drain cleaning with cleanouts is a lot more reliable at getting rid of obstructions. Many homes have drain cleanouts, however, we experience older homes without cleanouts. If you are having drain problems, a professional plumber can include cleanouts to your home.</p>
