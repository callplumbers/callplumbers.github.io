<p>Echologics has a long history of developing acclaimed acoustic technologies for leak detection on buried water pipelines. Running a video camera through the household sewer pipes (normally from the house to its connection to the general public sewer system) can be used to evaluate the type and condition of underground pipes, and to recognize problems like leaking or broken joints, intruding roots, clogs, deterioration or collapsed pipes. Homeowners might have a video inspection done to find the reason for routine sewer backups or other ongoing problems, or when offering or buying an older home.</p>
