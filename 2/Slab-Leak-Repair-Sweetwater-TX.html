<p>A lowered pressure zone backflow device (RPZ) is a testable kind of backflow prevention device that is installed in high danger" applications. The RPZ resembles the DC. It has two spring checks, but likewise has a 3rd check valve that is actually a vent open to environment on the bottom of the valve (kept closed by the water pressure). The reason it is used in high-risk circumstances is since if the first check valve ever malfunctions, the bottom of the valve then opens and drains.

Water pressure might be or fail decreased when a water pipe bursts, pipes freeze, or there is unexpectedly high demand on the water supply (for example, when a number of fire hydrants are opened).
