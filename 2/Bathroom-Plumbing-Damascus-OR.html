<p>The next criteria to evaluate is how the backflow prevention assembly is installed. It is important that the repair professional knows the correct installation orientation and can evaluate the installation conditions to ensure there are no conditions preventing the working of the assembly. The backflow prevention assembly must be set up in the installation orientation for which it was approved. A lot of backflow preventers are installed in a horizontal orientation to the surrounding grade. Some (not all) backflow preventers can be installed in a vertical orientation, however it is necessary that the assembly just be installed if it is approved for that orientation. To arbitrarily take an RP and stand it on its end in a vertical orientation may trigger the backflow prevention assembly to not work effectively and no matter how many parts you put inside the assembly, it still may not work due to the fact that the installation orientation is causing the failure.</p>
<p>Pieces that consist of kitchen sink drains can end up being worn and corroded, resulting in leaks. Depending on the seriousness of the scenario, just one piece may need replacement, or the entire under-sink assembly needs to be removed and changed.

Incorrectly set up P-traps or S-traps that are propped up or are not protected by nut joints and washers, must be reconfigured.</p>
