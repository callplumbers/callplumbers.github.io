<p>Surface Area Accelerated Condensation is a development that simulates biomineralization, the system typically recognized for structured development in the environment, consisting of seashells. Water softening is attained with SACr by using exclusive polymer beads to produce insoluble carbonate crystals from calcium and magnesium bicarbonates. The beads speed up the growth of carbonate crystals, which can be filtered to completely get rid of short-term hardness in water.</p>
<p>Requirements in NFPA 13: Requirement for the Installation of Sprinkler Systems for setting up backflow preventers and in NFPA 25: Standard for the Inspection, Testing and Maintenance of Water-Based Fire Protection Systems for performing yearly forward circulation tests are often perceived as a mandate to have them. But the intent of the code is to only attach installation and ITM requirements to systems where backflow preventers exist.</p>
<p>If you see low water pressure or discolored water, it normally signifies rust and mineral buildup. As rust and minerals build up gradually, they restrict the circulation of the water which is why you may observe lower water pressure. The discoloration happens when rust becomes loose from the pipes and flow into your water system, affecting the water quality. Having plumbing pipes that have rust or corrosion can become a health risk in your water.</p>
