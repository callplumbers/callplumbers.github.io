<p>Many homeowners will use a store-bought chemical drain cleaner to fix their clogged or dirty drain issues. These chemicals are easy to utilize and economical, but they harm your pipes and their effects are just short term. Store-bought liquid drain cleaners utilize harsh chemicals to gnaw at the clog and with repeated use, these chemicals will also gnaw at the pipe creating vulnerable points that are susceptible to burst. This is why professional drain cleaning from a drain cleaning company is always advised.</p>
<p>A variety of organizations, such as the American Water Functions Association (AWWA) and the American Backflow Prevention Association (ABPA) use certification courses designed to train specialists to check backflow preventers. Requirements for training vary by jurisdiction. Inspection of backflow preventers requires knowledge of installation requirements, although inspectors are not needed to end up being certified.</p>
