<p>Echologics has a long history of developing acclaimed acoustic innovations for leak detection on buried water pipelines. Running a video camera through the household sewer pipes (generally from your home to its connection to the public sewer system) can be used to evaluate the type and condition of underground pipes, and to identify problems like leaking or broken joints, intruding roots, clogs, deterioration or collapsed pipes. House owners may have a video inspection done to discover the reason for regular sewer backups or other ongoing problems, or when offering or buying an older house.</p>
