<p>An overall repipe of a house's water supply, typically done to replace leaking polybutylene pipes, is the most expensive and detailed plumbing task, says Steven Wood, president of Flo-Right Services, a plumbing company concentrating on entire home repiping. Recent Evaluation: Carlos and Lopez were remarkable. My 90 year old Dad's sewer line clogged on Thanksgiving Day and Carlos got to 8am the next day to repair. It was a hard task due to the fact that of the age of the house and area of the pipe. They worked for almost 12 hours into darkness to make certain the system was working before they left. I am truly grateful for their effort and professionalism.</p>
<p>Water hardness is the quantity of dissolved calcium and magnesium in the water-- hard water is high in both calcium and magnesium. Due to the fact that soap reacts with the calcium to form soap residue, the reason you can feel the difference on your skin is. This leads to the need for more soap or cleaning agent to get things clean. And that's where the term hardness" came from ... it's tough to clean in.</p>

<p>A. Generally wax does not "spoil" on a basic floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to avoid leaks. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet is there to avoid odors. If you are experiencing a leak originating from below the floor-mounted toilet, you most likely have a partial (or complete blown) toilet interruption down the drain line (or the toilet is cracked in the bowl). Likewise, ensure the leak isn't coming from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "normal" unnoticed issue. Try putting a couple of drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a couple of hours if you aren't sure where the leak is coming from.</p>
