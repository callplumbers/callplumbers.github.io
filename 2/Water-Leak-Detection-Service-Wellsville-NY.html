<p>Viking SupplyNet's extensive stock of backflow valves and associated devices includes leading products from Wilkins, Ames, Watts, and others. Oxidants such as chlorine in the general public water supply respond with the polybutylene piping and acetal fittings, causing them to scale, flake, and become fragile. This results in micro-fractures and reduces the standard structural stability of the system. The system ends up being weak and might fail without warning, triggering damage to the building structure and personal effects. Inappropriate installation is also a common reason for polybutylene system failure, which can be almost difficult to detect.</p>
<p>Each element of the assembly need to be tested to identify what needs repair. The field test might not always show you the seriousness of the failure or whether repair parts beyond the basic rubber repair kit are required. There may be extra test procedures, beyond those established in the tester certification program, that can offer data showing the seriousness of the failure that might assist in the diagnostic analysis of the backflow prevention assembly.</p>
