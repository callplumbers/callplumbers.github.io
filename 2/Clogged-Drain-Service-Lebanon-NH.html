<p>Downsides to be aware of is that hybrid water heaters need to be set up in an area that stays between 40 to 90 degrees, or they will not work well. They need up to 7 feet of clearance from the floor to ceiling, due to the fact that the heat pump is on top of the hot water heater. Also, hybrids require as much as 1,000 cubic feet of uncooled space to record sufficient heat from the air, and a drain in close proximity to release the condensate.</p>
