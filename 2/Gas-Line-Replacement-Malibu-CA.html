<p>When the drinkable supply piping is linked to a system or fixture which exceeds the operating pressure of the supply piping, backpressure may happen. Higher pressure can be caused by booster pumps, boilers, pressure vessels, or raised piping in places such as high-rise buildings or tanks. Safe and clean and non-potable water or liquids can be forced into the drinkable supply system if these connections are not correctly safeguarded.</p>
<p>Letters are sent out to residential customers with known backflow devices on an annual basis. The City's plumbing code requires a backflow preventer on all landscape watering systems, pool, and jacuzzis. Rotate the disposal system to line up the discharge tailpiece with the drain trap, and then connect it. Relying on the existing trap configuration, you might need to replace some or all of the drain piping beneath the sink to accommodate the disposal.</p>
