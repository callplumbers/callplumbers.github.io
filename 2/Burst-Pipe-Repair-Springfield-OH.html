<p>Kcb plumbing contractors, Inc Most of the homes in our area were built prior to 1965, which is the time when copper piping for cold and hot water ended up being basic. Older homes were installed with galvanized iron cut and thread pipe. Iron that comes in contact with water and oxygen will wear away. This rust, or rust, triggers the iron to inflate and become flaky. In order to prevent the rusting of the iron, the pipes were dipped in zinc.

<p>Newer models, such as tankless water heaters, are far more energy-efficient and can assist you save on your regular monthly utility expenses. Homeowner who receive a supply of tough water should get a water conditioner device like a water softener installed at their place.

<p>Water softening makes use of a process called "ion exchange" to eliminate liquified hard water minerals such as calcium, magnesium, iron and manganese. These minerals can't be caught by a filter, so a molecular reaction is required. Water softeners have resin beads that hold onto sodium, and as the difficult water flows through the resin, the salt is switched for the hard water minerals. The difficult water minerals are caught in the softener and a trace quantity of sodium flows out with the softened water.</p>
