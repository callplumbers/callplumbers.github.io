<h3>Clearing Blocked Drains in Madison SD 57042</h3>
<p>Backflow implies the unwanted turnaround of flow of a liquid, gas, or suspended strong into the potable supply of water; a backflow preventer is created to keep this from taking place. Points at which a safe and clean water system connects with a non-potable water supply are called cross connections. Such connections take place naturally in home appliances such as clothing washers and dishwashers, but they need to be thoroughly developed and set up to prevent backflow. Another typical place for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water main, to avoid pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the general public water system.</p>
<p>Requirements in NFPA 13: Standard for the Installation of Sprinkler Systems for setting up backflow preventers and in NFPA 25: Standard for the Inspection, Testing and Maintenance of Water-Based Fire Protection Systems for carrying out annual forward flow tests are in some cases perceived as a mandate to have them. However the intent of the code is to only connect installation and ITM requirements to systems where backflow preventers are present.</p>
