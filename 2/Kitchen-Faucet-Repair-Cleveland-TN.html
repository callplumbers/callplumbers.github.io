<p>Backpressure backflow is brought on by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or customer's drinkable water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the drinkable water supply pressure) can arise from an increase in downstream pressure, a reduction in the drinkable water system pressure, or a mix of both. Increases in downstream pressure can be created by pumps, temperature increases in boilers, etc. Decreases in drinkable water supply pressure take place whenever the amount of water being utilized exceeds the quantity of water being provided, such as throughout water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>
