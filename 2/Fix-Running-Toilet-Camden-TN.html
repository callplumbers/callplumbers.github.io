<p>Note: Tough water stops your washing detergent from working efficiently since difficult water ions can bond with detergent particles to deactivate them. You, for that reason, have to use increasingly more detergent to achieve the very same cleaning power. The media gets a bath in the salt option. Difficult minerals caught in the resin (or zeolite) are launched and the media gets replenished with sodium ions. The water softener is likewise cleaned up and decontaminated throughout regrowth. Finally, water containing the tough minerals and other waste gets eliminated of the system.</p>
