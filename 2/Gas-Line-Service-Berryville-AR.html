<p>Figuring out if you need a water softener is an individual preference. Water softener systems work by eliminating firmness minerals and replacing them with salt ions. Water conditioners are gadgets that help avoid the hardness-forming minerals from forming scale. They use a physical media to prevent the scale from developing by neutralizing the hardness itself. Due to the reality that water conditioners utilize a physical media rather of a chemical media, they are sometimes thought about a greener option in areas where it is prohibited to use salt. Water conditioners do not successfully eliminate hardness from the water supply, however, as the only method to do this is with a salt-based media.</p>
