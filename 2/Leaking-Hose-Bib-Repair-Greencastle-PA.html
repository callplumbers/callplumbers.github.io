<p>Pieces that consist of kitchen sink drains can become rusty and worn, leading to leaks. Depending on the seriousness of the scenario, only one piece might need replacement, or the whole under-sink assembly should be gotten rid of and replaced. Components involved include slip nut joints and washers, tubing leading from the sink, P-trap or S-trap assemblies and sink drain baskets. Poorly set up P-traps or S-traps that are propped up or are not protected by nut joints and washers, need to be reconfigured.</p>
