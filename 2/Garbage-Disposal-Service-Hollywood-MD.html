<p>In addition to water softening systems, Rinckey stated that reverse osmosis systems (ROs) are quite popular with property owners in the area. He noted that there are certain impurities that citizens are dealing with and an RO can help alleviate those problems. Due to being mainly farming in Montcalm and Ionia counties, some homeowners are installing ROs to rid their water source of nitrates that are a product of farming waste. Rinckey noted that these systems remove around 94 percent of nitrates. Arsenic also naturally happens in some soils and that too can be treated with the ideal RO system.</p>
<p>One typical way for a house's supply of water to be infected is if the irrigation water lines, which might end up being tainted by pesticides or weed toxin, backflow into the interior water lines. If that infected water were to backflow into the community drinking supply, the issue might spread significantly. A backflow preventer not only safeguards drinking water in individual residences, it also prevents wastewater in personal houses from flowing back out and contaminating the public water system.</p>
