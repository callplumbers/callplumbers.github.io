<p>Garbage Disposal Installation Fed Up With False Assures?

When the resin beads have actually maxed out their ability to hold calcium and magnesium, it's time for them to be charged (a process called regrowth). During this procedure, the resin beads are cleaned with the highly concentrated saltwater service (brine) from the tank (made from the salt you contributed to the tank). The brine forces the calcium and magnesium ions to be launched from the beads and replaced with salt or potassium ions.</p>
