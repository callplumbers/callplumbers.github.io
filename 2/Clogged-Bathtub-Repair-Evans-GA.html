<p>ow gadgets prevent utilized water from reentering the District's safe and clean supply of water in the event of a breakdown in a customer's pressure equipment or an abrupt drop in pressure in EBMUD's water system.

His plan was to offer a complete range of services.</p>
<p>Backflow is the undesirable turnaround of flow in a safe and clean water circulation system. Water that is always under pressure can only stream in one direction. Then how can water flow in reverse? Water will constantly stream toward the point of most affordable pressure. If a water main were to break or if the fire department opened numerous fire hydrants to assist battle a fire, the pressure in the water main could drop. The need upstream might cause a turnaround in circulation.</p>
