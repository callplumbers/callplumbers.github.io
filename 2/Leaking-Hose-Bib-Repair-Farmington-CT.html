<p>Depending on your situation, your plumber might utilize one or a combination of piping material throughout your house repiping project. Copper is standard due to the fact that it's lasting, can survive fires, and withstands weather. However, copper is difficult to install, which implies greater labor costs. PEX or polyethylene pipes have the advantage of versatility, which means plumbers can flex the pipes eliminating the need for joints, which conserves time and money and reduces the danger of joint leaks.

You can attempt to do this yourself, but this isn't a beginner's Do It Yourself project. If you use the tool improperly, you can harm your pipes and cause other leaks - so it's worth it to call somebody who knows the drill.</p>
