<p>Water softeners generally have a life-span of 15 years, however, water softener systems can last much longer if they are properly preserved. Making certain the brine tank never lacks salt will extend the unit's life.  Safeguarding the resin bed from high levels of iron and manganese will likewise protect the system. Iron will foul the resin and lower its ion exchange performance. Resin cleaners improve the regeneration cycle and help alleviate the resin beads of hardness-causing minerals.</p>
