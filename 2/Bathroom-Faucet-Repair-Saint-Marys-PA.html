<p>A general rule is that you can regain the cost of the repair if the problems takes place well outside that 8 to 12 year life-span. If, state, you need a brand-new burner package and the hot water heater is five years old, then it makes good sense for you to invest the $120 for the part, specifically if you can do the work yourself.
