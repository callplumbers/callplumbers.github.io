Such connections take place naturally in home appliances such as clothes washers and dishwashers, however they must be thoroughly designed and set up to avoid backflow. Another typical place for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water main, to avoid pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the public supply of water.</p>
