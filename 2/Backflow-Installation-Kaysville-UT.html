You, therefore, have to utilize more and more cleaning agent to accomplish the exact same cleaning power. The media gets a bath in the salt solution. Tough minerals captured in the resin (or zeolite) are released and the media gets replenished with salt ions. The water softener is also cleaned and decontaminated during regrowth. Finally, water containing the tough minerals and other waste gets eliminated of the system.</p>
