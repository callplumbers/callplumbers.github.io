<h2>Tips To Hire Professional Plumbing Services in Muscle Shoals</h2>
<p><img src="https://plumbingimages.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/plumbing.jpg" alt=""><p>
<p>Kcb plumbing contractors, Inc The majority of the houses in our area were built before 1965, which is the time when copper piping for cold and hot water ended up being standard. Older homes were installed with galvanized iron cut and thread pipe. Iron that can be found in contact with water and oxygen will rust. This corrosion, or rust, causes the iron to inflate and end up being flaky. In order to avoid the rusting of the iron, the pipes were dipped in zinc. The zinc bonds with the iron and creates a waterproof membrane to protect the iron from rusting.</p>
<p>Our service trucks are completely equipped with the parts needed to finish any plumbing repair in one see. We provide same-day service for toilet repair and installation with in advance prices and free estimates. Our specialists will examine your toilet to identify if it can be repaired, describe the work that is required, and provide an estimate for the complete cost of the task.</p>
