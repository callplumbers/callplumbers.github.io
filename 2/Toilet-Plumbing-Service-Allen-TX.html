<p>A. Using phosphoric acid typically will help remove them if you have rust spots. If you want to attempt the gentlest method maybe attempt utilizing some Coke on the rust first.  No, we aren't kidding, Coca-Cola contains a trace amount of phosphoric acid. To try this, drain the toilet bowl to below where the rust marks are. Then pour on some Coke.

<p>Button Plumbing was terrific. They changed my kitchen faucet and added 2 brand-new shut off valves under the sink which had actually always dripped in the previous if I shut down the water under the sink. I mentioned that my bathroom sink was draining sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were very friendly and got the work done rapidly. The cost was rather sensible. I will absolutely use them for any future plumbing needs. I was very pleased with their service.</p>
