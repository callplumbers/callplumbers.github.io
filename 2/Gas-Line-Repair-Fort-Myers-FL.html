Which is why picking a comfy, well-made toilet seat is incredibly important. However, you have to make certain your toilet seat actually fits your toilet. Most of toilets are standard sized - meaning a "will fit" seat is sufficient for security and convenience. Some toilets, nevertheless, have distinctively formed bowls and require a specific seat, like the Eljer Emblem. It really isn't a great concept to use a toilet seat that is either much too huge or much to small, unless they have actually been particularly developed to fit regular toilets, as the toilet seat can wobble and cause you to move around, or won't disperse your weight uniformly and might eventually cause cracks in the bowl.</p>
