<p>A minimized pressure zone backflow device (RPZ) is a testable kind of backflow prevention device that is installed in high threat" applications. The RPZ resembles the DC. It has two spring checks, but also has a 3rd check valve that is really a vent open up to environment on the bottom of the valve (kept closed by the water pressure). The reason it is utilized in high-risk situations is because if the first check valve ever malfunctions, the bottom of the valve then drains and opens. This relief valve uses an extra layer of defense compared to the DC, which will enable backflow if both check valves breakdown. This is the factor that when you test an RPZ, you force water to backflow to make sure the RPZ discharges.</p>
