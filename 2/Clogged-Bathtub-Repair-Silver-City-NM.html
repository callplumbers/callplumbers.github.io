<p>The High Voltage Leak Detection Innovation (HVLD) testing process consists of a set of electrode probes which scans a sealed container made of a non-conductive product. Tank water heaters are the most common, and are run with gas. Their design includes an insulated tank where water is warmed and saved till needed. Gas water heaters are more energy effective and operating costs are reduced by about 50 percent, compared to electrical hot water heater.

<p>Backflow prevention assemblies are developed to supply decades of protection. There are numerous local conditions that can reduce the working life of a backflow preventer.  Conditions such as extreme pressure, water temperature, turbidity or quality can all cause the assembly to deteriorate in its performance.
