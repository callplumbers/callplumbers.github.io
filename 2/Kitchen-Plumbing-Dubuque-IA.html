<p>If a gas water heater or an electric system is more affordable, property owners frequently ask. The answer depends upon your house. While gas models are cheaper to operate, they do need an existing natural gas line. The price tag of an electric hot water heater is usually lower, however it can be more expensive to run. Electric ranges are also simpler to install, and unlike gas units, they are less likely to lose heat.</p>
