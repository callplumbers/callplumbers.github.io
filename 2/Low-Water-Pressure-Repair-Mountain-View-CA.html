<p>Keep in mind: Difficult water stops your washing cleaning agent from working successfully because tough water ions can bond with cleaning agent molecules to deactivate them. You, for that reason, have to utilize increasingly more cleaning agent to attain the very same cleaning power. The media gets a bath in the salt service. Difficult minerals captured in the resin (or zeolite) are launched and the media gets renewed with sodium ions. The water softener is likewise cleaned up and disinfected throughout regeneration. Finally, water containing the difficult minerals and other waste gets flushed out of the system.</p>
