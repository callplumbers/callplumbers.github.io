<p>These men were amazing! They showed up early and remained late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has actually been a problem off and on for many years now. It was installed 7 years back, and it never ever drained this well. I chose this company since they had terrific reviews and a reasonable price, and although the job took a lot more time and work than they expected it to, they honored their quote. I will use Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing needs in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were monsters. They had a substantial, disgusting mess on their hands (actually), and they did an excellent task cleaning up after it also.</p>
