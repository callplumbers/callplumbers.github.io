<p>Sewer linings can assist to repair cracked pipes without needing to totally replace your sewer lines or ruin the area around them. Everyday usage should not trigger a water softener to leak. Leakages can also happen if you run into the softener and jostle it, pulling the fitting apart. To avoid this from occurring, install the system in a safe and stable  area. If you reside in an earthquake-prone area of the country, protect the softener so that if the foundation begins moving, the softener does not tip over and remove the plumbing. You must wait up until after the cycle is completed and then examined the system for cracks or broken fittings if your water softener is leaking during regrowth. You should also examine to make certain your drain line is never blocked up with debris. A clogged drain line can blow off of the softener throughout regrowth and flood your basement or garage.</p>
