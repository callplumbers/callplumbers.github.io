<p>E.R. Services comprehends the importance of keeping the integrity and performance of your kitchen. Sediment Accumulation: If you see weird popping, banging, or clanging sounds originating from your unit, this might be an indication that sediment has actually developed in your tank, and is causing a reaction with the heating component. Running out of warm water rapidly is another sign of sediment accumulation, because the sediment is taking up more space in the tank, so your water for that reason takes longer to heat. To fix this issue, you will likely need to flush out the tank.</p>

<p>A partial reroute is essentially a small scale repiping of one or more afflicted areas of the plumbing underneath the slab. In cases where fixing the pipe and jackhammering are not cost reliable, it is possible to only abandon the affected section of pipe and reroute the line through the walls, attics and ceilings. Costing less than a complete repipe, the end outcome is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that may leak once again in the future. We have actually experienced houses having 2 or more slab leakages within a 1-2 year duration, and these repairs can add up in cost really quickly. This is the main reason why we will recommend a full repipe in particular communities, based upon our experience.</p>
