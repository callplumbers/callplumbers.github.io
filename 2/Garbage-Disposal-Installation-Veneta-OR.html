<p>Garbage Disposal Installation Sick Of False Assures? Water distributes in the tank where tiny resin beads swap the calcium and magnesium in the water for the salt or potassium they're holding. The beads act as a sponge, adsorbing the solidity minerals from your water. This process is described as ion exchange, and soft water is the result. When the resin beads have maxed out their capability to hold calcium and magnesium, it's time for them to be recharged (a procedure called regrowth). During this process, the resin beads are cleaned with the extremely concentrated saltwater solution (salt water) from the tank (made from the salt you added to the tank).
