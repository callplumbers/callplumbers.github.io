<p>Your garbage disposal guarantees that your sink and plumbing components do not get clogged. Contrary to some individuals's perception, garbage disposals do not contain blades. Instead, a garbage disposal includes two fixed bolts that are fixed to a spinning disk.

This high-speed action effectively crushes the food waste in the disposal so that it can take a trip down the drain without obstructing.</p>
