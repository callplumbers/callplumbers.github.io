Because these systems do not work by exchanging ions, like standard water softeners do, one advantage claimed for the user is the removal of the need to include salt to the system. While particle size decrease and plant development promotion have been declared, such systems do not eliminate minerals from the water itself. Rather, they can just change the downstream results that the mineral-bearing water would otherwise have.
