<p>The source or place of a sewer issue determines who pays for repair. The City is accountable for the general public right-of-way (curb to suppress), from one side of the street to another. The homeowner is accountable for the area from the curb to the back of their home line. Easements (normally 10 feet broad) where main sewers pass through private property are an exception to this rule.</p>
<p>Prior to our professional specialists can begin applying their skills and experience, we first need to guarantee that the line is correctly cleaned and prepared for our repair. Our repair processes depend on having a clean, smooth pipeline, otherwise, flaws brought on by waste accumulation can prevent the liner from sticking to the walls correctly. We clean the sewer lines with hydro jetting, a service that permits a thorough cleaning by blasting streams of hot, pressurized water directly into the line. The special nozzle attached to the hose directs the water in all instructions to allow the water to cover the whole diameter of the sewer line and provide a mindful cleaning.</p>
