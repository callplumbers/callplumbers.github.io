<p>Button Plumbing was terrific. If I shut off the water under the sink, they changed my kitchen faucet and added two brand-new shut off valves under the sink which had always dripped in the past. I pointed out that my bathroom sink was draining pipes sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were really friendly and got the work done quickly. The rate was quite sensible. I will definitely use them for any future plumbing needs. I was very delighted with their service.</p>
