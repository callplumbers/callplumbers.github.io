<p>Manual leak detection for drainage applications is the most basic of the 3 available methods. Tankless systems last 5-10 years longer than tanked units and need fewer repairs with time. Sanford & Boy plumbing offers sink repair and replacement services to all Lake Elsinore, Temecula, Murrieta, Sun City, Menifee, Wildomar, and surrounding areas. Throughout regrowth, salty water from the salt water tank streams up the fill tube and into the softener tank.
