<p>Once the hardware parts have actually been cleaned and checked and the rubber parts have actually been changed, now reassemble the parts back into their parts. Some components may have really tight tolerances that need to be preserved. An important thing to recognize on each part is the guide. The guide is the part that directs or steadies the movement of the part. The guide is a very vital part of the design of each part. If the element is not repaired properly, the guide might limit the motion (rather than direct or constant) of the element, which could trigger the component to not work to its abilities. Lot of times springs are incorrectly blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. In many cases the guides are restricting the travel of the component causing lower test outcomes than what is needed.</p>

<p>Light Blue = Decreased Pressure Zone - supply pressure pushes open the # 1 check and is lowered by the # 1 Inspect spring (for instance, to 90 psi). This pressure distinction throughout the # 1 check valve keeps the relief valve in the closed position.
