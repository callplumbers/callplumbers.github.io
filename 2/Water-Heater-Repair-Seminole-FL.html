The flywheel is jammed: If the disposal hums when you flip the switch, however it doesn't grind up food, this implies the flywheel is stuck.

<p>When the hardware parts have actually been cleaned and checked and the rubber parts have actually been changed, now reassemble the parts back into their components. Some parts may have extremely tight tolerances that need to be kept. An essential thing to determine on each part is the guide. The guide is the part that directs or steadies the movement of the component. The guide is a really crucial part of the design of each part. If the element is not repaired properly, the guide could restrict the movement (instead of direct or stable) of the part, which could cause the component to not work to its capabilities. Sometimes springs are mistakenly blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. For the most part the guides are limiting the travel of the part triggering lower test results than what is needed.</p>
