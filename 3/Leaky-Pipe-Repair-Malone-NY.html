<p>A total repipe of a house's water system, typically done to replace leaking polybutylene pipes, is the most intricate and pricey plumbing task, says Steven Wood, president of Flo-Right Services, a plumbing company specializing in whole house repiping. Recent Evaluation: Carlos and Lopez were amazing. My 90 years of age Dad's sewer line clogged on Thanksgiving Day and Carlos came to 8am the next day to repair. It was a difficult task since of the age of your house and place of the pipe. They worked for almost 12 hours into darkness to make sure the system was working before they left. I am truly grateful for their effort and professionalism.</p>
