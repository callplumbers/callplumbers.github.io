<p>As soon as the hardware parts have been cleaned and checked and the rubber parts have actually been replaced, now reassemble the parts back into their components. Some components might have really tight tolerances that have to be maintained. A crucial thing to determine on each element is the guide. The guide is the part that directs or steadies the motion of the element. The guide is an extremely vital part of the design of each component. If the element is not repaired correctly, the guide might restrict the motion (instead of constant or direct) of the element, which might cause the component to not work to its abilities. Often times springs are erroneously blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. Most of the times the guides are restricting the travel of the part triggering lower test results than what is required.</p>

<p>Plumbing contractors who want to run their own plumbing company might think about completing a postsecondary service degree program.

<p>The next criteria to assess is how the backflow prevention assembly is installed. It is very important that the repair specialist understands the correct installation orientation and can assess the installation conditions to ensure there are no conditions preventing the working of the assembly. The backflow prevention assembly should be set up in the installation orientation for which it was approved. Many backflow preventers are installed in a horizontal orientation to the surrounding grade. Some (not all) backflow preventers can be set up in a vertical orientation, however it is very important that the assembly only be installed if it is authorized for that orientation. To arbitrarily take an RP and stand it on its end in a vertical orientation might trigger the backflow prevention assembly to not work correctly and no matter the number of parts you put inside the assembly, it still might not work because the installation orientation is triggering the failure.</p>
