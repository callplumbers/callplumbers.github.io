If your building has an existing backflow preventer, however the DEP has no record of its installation, you need to have a licensed professional file a record illustration of the device, as well as an initial test report of the device for DEP review.</p>
<p>Button Plumbing was excellent. They changed my kitchen faucet and added 2 brand-new shut off valves under the sink which had constantly leaked in the previous if I shut off the water under the sink. I mentioned that my bathroom sink was draining slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were really friendly and got the work done quickly. The cost was quite affordable. I will certainly utilize them for any future plumbing needs. I was super happy with their service.</p>
