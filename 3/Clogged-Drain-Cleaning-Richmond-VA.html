<p>Reverse osmosis uses an applied pressure gradient across a semi permeable membrane to overcome osmotic pressure and remove water particles from the solution with solidity ions. The membrane has pores large enough to confess water particles for passage; hardness ions such as Ca2+ and Mg2+ will not fit through the pores.

You can't always be specific whether the house has actually had drainage problems, and if so, whether the previous house owner understood the reason for the clog A basic camera inspection might make you familiar with a concealed and very pricey  issue prior to the purchase.</p>
