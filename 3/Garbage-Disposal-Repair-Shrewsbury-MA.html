<p>Loose flanges are typically the result of wood rot. The flange screws just won't keep in the soft, decayed subfloor. The very best option depends upon the level of the rot. If the rot is only under the flange, utilize an ear-type repair ring. The ears let you drive screws into firm wood farther away from the flange. Before you install this sort of ring, hold it up to the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You may need to cut off a couple of ears to make it work with your toilet.
