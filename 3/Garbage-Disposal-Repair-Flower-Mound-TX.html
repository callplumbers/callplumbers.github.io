<p>The list of things a food disposer can consume is relatively short. Soft or crisp foods are fine, however difficult or stringy foods can be trouble. Disposers can be stopped in their tracks by celery, eggshells and apple seeds, as well as the usual kitchen flotsam, including pop-tabs, scouring twist-ties and pads. While some older houses may not have backflow preventers, all newer residential or commercial properties are needed to have them. Doug's can help you find and determine them if you're not sure what kind of backflow preventers are utilized in your house or organisation. We can also perform your yearly backflow inspections.</p>
<p>House water softeners, also called ion exchange units, are home appliances that get rid of calcium, magnesium, and other minerals from drinking water. Resin beads inside the softener trap the calcium and magnesium and exchange them for salt or potassium. Once the resin beads become loaded with calcium and magnesium, a highly-concentrated salt or potassium solution eliminates the calcium and magnesium from the beads. After passing through the beads, the resulting chloride solution becomes a waste stream that decreases the drain and eventually into the environment.</p>
<p>Gas line leaks are a major security issue. Do not take any possibilities. Make certain the softener is set to the firmness of your supply of water. If the hardness is set too high, the softener will cost more to operate and waste water, costing you additional money.
