While gas models are less expensive to run, they do require an existing gas line. The cost of an electric water heater is generally lower, but it can be more expensive to run. Electric ranges are also easier to install, and unlike gas units, they are less most likely to lose heat.</p>

The addition of this chemical additive will need the installation of a high risk defense assembly.</p>
