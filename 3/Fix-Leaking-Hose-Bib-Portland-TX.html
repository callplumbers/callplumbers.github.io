<p>Toilet flush handles are another part of a toilet that can trigger toilets to keep running. Often deals with are toilet parts that get loose or rusty and no longer pull the flap up or drop it back down effectively. It's a simple repair, however there's a technique to getting the flush deal with out. The retaining nut inside the tank is a reverse thread. So, if you remain in front of the toilet, turn the nut to the left to loosen (Image 1). Then get rid of the old manage and lever, slide the brand-new handle into place, and thread on the keeping nut. Tighten by relying on the right (Photo 2).</p>
