Nevertheless, there are numerous downsides to using these harmful products - not least of which is that they usually contain substances such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by liquifying whatever is causing a blockage, which can range from the normal suspects like hair or food to mineral buildup, little items, dirt, and even roots in cases where split pipes on your property draw the attention of plant life.
