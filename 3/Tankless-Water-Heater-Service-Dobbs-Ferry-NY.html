<p>Water softening utilizes a procedure called "ion exchange" to get rid of dissolved difficult water minerals such as calcium, magnesium, iron and manganese. These minerals can't be trapped by a filter, so a molecular response is required.

The hard water minerals are trapped in the softener and a trace quantity of sodium drains with the softened water.</p>
