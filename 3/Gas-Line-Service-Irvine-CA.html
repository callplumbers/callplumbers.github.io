Some elements might have very tight tolerances that have to be maintained. A crucial thing to identify on each part is the guide. The guide is the part that directs or steadies the motion of the element. The guide is an extremely crucial part of the style of each element. If the part is not fixed appropriately, the guide might limit the motion (instead of steady or direct) of the component, which might cause the component to not work to its abilities.
