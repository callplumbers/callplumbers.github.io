<p>By itself, gas is colorless and odorless. Most utility companies include a sulfur substance to gas, which is where the rotten egg smell comes from.

<p>You can use a wire coat hanger by correcting it if you don't have a plumber's snake. Naturally, it won't reach as far as a plumber's snake would, however it may be long enough to reach some clogs. If you can reach it, insert it into the kitchen drain or stub pipe to press through or pull out the clog. Be careful not to scratch your sink with the wire.</p>

<p>Gas is the one we are most carefully exposed to. This gas is used for heating our houses, for lightening our ranges, and for running devices such as hot water heater. This gas is made of a hydrocarbon called methane, unofficially called marsh gas or swamp gas. Methane is a naturally happening gas that occurs in the earth's crust and is also often formed by the decaying of raw materials like sewage or manure. As helpful as this gas is, the features that make this gas dangerous is its odorless and colorless nature, that makes it a quiet killer. However, to thwart off that hazard, mercaptans are added into natural gas, which provides it a rotten egg odor and makes it noticeable when leaking. Make certain to just rely on an utmost professional with your gas line repair in Richmond.</p>
