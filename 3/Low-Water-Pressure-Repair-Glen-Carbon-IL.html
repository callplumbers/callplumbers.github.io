<p>Backpressure backflow is brought on by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or consumer's drinkable water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the drinkable water system pressure) can result from an increase in downstream pressure, a reduction in the drinkable water system pressure, or a combination of both. Increases in downstream pressure can be created by pumps, temperature level boosts in boilers, etc. Reductions in safe and clean water supply pressure occur whenever the amount of water being used exceeds the amount of water being provided, such as throughout water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>
<p>Your existing waste disposal unit is likely a constant feed design.

<p>Backpressure backflow in a structure results when the pressure in the system is higher than the pressure of the incoming drinkable supply of water. Backpressure can be brought on by pumps or temperature level increases in boilers, or if there is a decrease in the water system pressure. Backsiphonage takes place when negative or lower pressure develops in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, usually due to an interruption or drain in the supply, such as water pipe repairs or breaks, or nearby firefighting activity. To avoid backflow, a backflow preventer device is installed on each main water service line-- domestic and fire water-- feeding the structure. A common type of backflow preventer is the reduced pressured zone (RPZ) assembly.</p>
