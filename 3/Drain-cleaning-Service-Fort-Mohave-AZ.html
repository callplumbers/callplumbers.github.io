<p>Almost all softeners fall under one of 2 classifications. Timed designs have programmable timeclocks that will regenerate on a fixed schedule and after that go back to service. These work well for households that are on regular water-using cycles but will waste more water and salt due to the fact that they regrow whether the resin needs it or not. Demand-control designs, with either mechanical and electrical sensors, generally restore after a lot of gallons of water have actually been softened. Such models are convenient if you have a changing water use schedule.</p>
