<p>Often, an inexperienced individual will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the assumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair may be as simple as changing a couple of rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or might need the replacement of some of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester performs a field test, he generates information on the functions of the assembly.  It becomes the tester's task to understand what the field test information suggests for that particular assembly.  When a trained tester interprets the data, he can identify what parts of the backflow prevention assembly stopped working the test and requires repair.</p>
