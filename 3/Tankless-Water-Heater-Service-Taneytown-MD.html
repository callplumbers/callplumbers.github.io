<p>As a locally-owned service, stability and responsibility are extremely important to building a credibility for quality.

Again, the very best type of backflow prevention is an air gap, such as the outlet of a faucet and where water would stream over the rim of a sink or bathtub. The Warren County Plumbing Department checks to guarantee there is an air space, if there is no other way to provide one, then we examine to see that the proper BFP device is set up. These BFP's, if testable, are needed to be checked (by a certified backflow preventer tester) upon installation and at least every twelve months afterwards.</p>
