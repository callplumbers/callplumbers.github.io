Oxidants such as chlorine in the public water supply respond with the polybutylene piping and acetal fittings, triggering them to scale, flake, and become fragile. This results in micro-fractures and minimizes the basic structural integrity of the system. The system ends up being weak and may fail without warning, triggering damage to the building structure and personal effects. Incorrect installation is likewise a common reason for polybutylene system failure, which can be nearly impossible to find.</p>
