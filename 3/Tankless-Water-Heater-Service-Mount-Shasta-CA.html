<p>Requirements in NFPA 13: Requirement for the Installation of Sprinkler Systems for installing backflow preventers and in NFPA 25: Requirement for the Inspection, Testing and Maintenance of Water-Based Fire Defense Systems for carrying out yearly forward flow tests are often perceived as a mandate to have them.

Acids are substances that release hydrogen ions, which oxidize the metals in pipes, speeding up rust Co2 will potentially add to the development of carbonic acid, thereby making the water more corrosive.
