The provider need to get an authorization before trenching. How often a backflow preventer requires to be tested depends on its type.

<p>Purchasing a house is a big investment. Knowing if you have galvanized water pipes, copper drain pipes, lead closet bends, or an inferior piping system can be useful when working out the sale of a home. There are a lot of kinds of piping systems and conditions, it's a good idea to get a whole house plumbing inspection in addition to a hot water heater and sewer camera inspection.</p>
<p>Often, an untrained person will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the assumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair might be as easy as replacing a couple of rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or may require the replacement of some of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester carries out a field test, he produces data on the workings of the assembly.  It becomes the tester's duty to know what the field test data means for that specific assembly.  When an experienced tester analyzes the information, he can determine what parts of the backflow prevention assembly failed the test and needs repair.</p>
