For example, if you lose your toilet bowl bolt covers (those little caps on the base of the toilet), the bolts holding your toilet to the floor will corrode far more rapidly. Constant gross smells coming from the toilet can show you need a brand-new wax ring where your toilet connects to the floor drain.
