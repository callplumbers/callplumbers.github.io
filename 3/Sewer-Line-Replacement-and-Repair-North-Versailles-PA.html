<p>An overall repipe of a home's water system, typically done to replace leaking polybutylene pipes, is the most pricey and elaborate plumbing task, says Steven Wood, president of Flo-Right Services, a plumbing company specializing in whole home repiping. For an outdoor gas light or home appliance whose gas supply line is buried, water leaking into the gas line can cause an obstruction or can trigger rust that blocks the line. Simply 4" of water pressure can be enough to block a natural gas line. Sound-- With time sediment can build up in the bottom of your tank. This sediment ultimately gets hard and takes away from the capacity of your water heater. This solidified sediment is most likely the source of the noise.</p>
