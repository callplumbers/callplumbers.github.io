<p>Troubleshooting is an issue. As a sewer and drain cleaning company, I run into circumstances, frequently that require a company such as Serve Pro to precede me on the job.

The drain line is clogged: If your kitchen sink clogs, never utilize chemical drain cleaner! Instead, call a plumber to clear the clog and find without harming your garbage disposal.</p>
<p>The next criteria to examine is how the backflow prevention assembly is set up. It is important that the repair professional understands the right installation orientation and can examine the installation conditions to ensure there are no conditions preventing the working of the assembly. The backflow prevention assembly should be set up in the installation orientation for which it was approved. The majority of backflow preventers are installed in a horizontal orientation to the surrounding grade. Some (not all) backflow preventers can be set up in a vertical orientation, but it is important that the assembly only be installed if it is approved for that orientation. To arbitrarily take an RP and stand it on its end in a vertical orientation may cause the backflow prevention assembly to not work effectively and no matter the number of parts you put inside the assembly, it still may not work because the installation orientation is triggering the failure.</p>
