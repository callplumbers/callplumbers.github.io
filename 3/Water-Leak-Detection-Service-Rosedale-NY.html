Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the drinkable supply of water pressure) can arise from an increase in downstream pressure, a decrease in the safe and clean water system pressure, or a combination of both. Pumps can produce increases in downstream pressure; temperature level increases in boilers, etc. Decreases in drinkable water system pressure take place whenever the amount of water being utilized goes beyond the amount of water being supplied, such as during water line flushing, fire fighting, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
