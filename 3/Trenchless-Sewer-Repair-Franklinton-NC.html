<p>Water softening makes use of a procedure called "ion exchange" to eliminate liquified tough water minerals such as calcium, iron, magnesium and manganese. These minerals can't be caught by a filter, so a molecular response is required.

The difficult water minerals are trapped in the softener and a trace amount of salt drains with the softened water.</p>
