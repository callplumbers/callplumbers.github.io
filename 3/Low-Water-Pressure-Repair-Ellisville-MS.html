These minerals can't be trapped by a filter, so a molecular response is required. Water softeners have resin beads that keep sodium, and as the difficult water streams through the resin, the sodium is switched for the hard water minerals. The tough water minerals are caught in a trace and the softener amount of sodium flows out with the softened water.</p>
