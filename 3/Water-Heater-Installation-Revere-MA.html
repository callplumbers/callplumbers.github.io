<p>Inspect the house's hot water heater You will be looking to see if it is big enough to accommodate your requirements (a family of four need to have at least a 40 gallon tank), where it is located, and the hot water heater's age. Check to see if there is an accumulation of mineral deposits in the tank, if possible. Mineral deposits can settle on the tank's bottom, leaving less room for water - which will imply that less water will be heated and available for usage. Likewise, deterioration of the tank's components can cause the tank to have a brief life. If the hot water heater is old or you see obvious indications of deterioration, demand that a new one be set up.</p>
