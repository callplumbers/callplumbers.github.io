<h3>Drains Blocked Find A Good Emergency Plumber Now Adrian MI</h3>
<p>To identify if your home is a poly home," begin with the outside. Underground water mains are usually blue in color (they can also be black or gray). The pipe is normally 1/2 to 1-inch in size. Frequently, it enters the home near the hot water heater. Your main turned off is attached to the end of the water pipe. Make sure you examine both ends of the pipe. We have discovered cases where the copper pipe gets in the house and polybutylene is at the meter.</p>
<p>Hydro jetting is a process in which the sewer pipes are scrubbed clean by streams of high-pressure water shooting from a hose at as much as 3,500 PSI. This enables the sewer lines to be cleaned up rapidly and effectively with high-velocity water pressure. The streams of high-pressure water, releasing from the forward and reverse jets in the nozzle, propel the hose through the line to get rid of particles such as tough water scale, grease, silt, and sand deposits.</p>
