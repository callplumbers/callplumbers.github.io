Difficult water interferes with the lathering of soaps and hair shampoos, triggering you to utilize more. Tough water also makes it harder to wash soap off your body, or hair shampoo out of your hair, which can result in dandruff and irritation of your skin or scalp. If you have chronically dry skin or eczema, you'll likely find that hard water triggers your skin to flake, itch, and redden frequently.</p>
