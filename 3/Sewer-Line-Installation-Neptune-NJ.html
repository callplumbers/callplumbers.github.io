<p>Backflow indicates the undesirable reversal of flow of a liquid, gas, or suspended strong into the potable water system; a backflow preventer is created to keep this from taking place. Points at which a safe and clean water supply gets in touch with a non-potable water system are called cross connections. Such connections happen naturally in home appliances such as clothes washers and dishwashing machines, but they need to be carefully developed and set up to prevent backflow. Another typical place for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water pipe, to avoid pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the public water supply.</p>
<p>The backflow preventer is a device that prevents impurities or pollutants from being drawn into the drinking water system. Numerous sprinkling systems currently have the appropriate backflow preventer set up and need only be tested each year. Others might not fulfill state and local policies and might need to be replaced with the correct backflow preventer.</p>
