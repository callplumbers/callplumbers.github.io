<p>Backpressure backflow in a building results when the pressure in the system is higher than the pressure of the inbound safe and clean water supply. Backpressure can be triggered by pumps or temperature level boosts in boilers, or if there is a reduction in the water supply pressure. Backsiphonage occurs when unfavorable or lower pressure establishes in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, typically due to a disruption or drain in the supply, such as water main repairs or breaks, or neighboring firefighting activity.

Examine to see if there is a buildup of mineral deposits in the tank, if possible. Mineral deposits can settle on the tank's bottom, leaving less room for water - which will mean that less water will be warmed and available for use. Likewise, corrosion of the tank's elements can cause the tank to have a brief life. Demand that a new one be installed if the water heater is old or you see apparent indications of rust.</p>
