Galvanized pipes were frequently installed in homes of this age, and these kinds of pipes are understood to corrode and burst when they get old. You may need to add a grounded outlet to power the garbage disposal if you don't currently have one if so. This generally includes anywhere from $75 to $150+ to the overall cost of the garbage disposal installation.</p>
