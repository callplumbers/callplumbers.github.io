<p>A functioning drainage and sewer system requires the appropriate installation of a skilled professional. Larry & Sons provides detailed sewer line and drain installation for basic drainage in municipal water materials, septic systems for those not connected to a city sewer system, and drain tile systems for basement water elimination Our specialist service technicians carefully install new drainage pipes and systems, and hand select parts that match your system's specific requirements.</p>
<p>Loose flanges are generally the result of wood rot. The flange screws simply will not hold in the soft, decayed subfloor. The best solution depends on the extent of the rot. Utilize an ear-type repair ring if the rot is just under the flange. The ears let you drive screws into firm wood further away from the flange. Before you install this type of ring, hold it as much as the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You might have to cut off a couple of ears to make it work with your toilet. If the rot extends well beyond the flange, you'll need to replace a section of the subfloor.</p>
<p>Everybody who's set up a couple of disposals knows this mistake: Forgetting to get rid of the dishwasher knockout before hanging the unit. Running water: If the toilet runs even when it hasn't been just recently utilized and you've replaced the flapper, the problem might be larger than it appears. The tank ultimately loses its ability to seal appropriately, producing waste and a greater water bill.</p>
