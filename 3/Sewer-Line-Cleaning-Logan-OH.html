<p>Do not put everything down your waste disposal unit. It is necessary to enjoy what you put down your waste disposal unit. Foods like rice and pasta can swell when blended with water, and possibly cause a clog. Fruit and vegetable peels can also trigger blockages and jams - consider composting or placing these products in the garbage. Furthermore, grease and oil can harden and collect in your drain too. After finishing cooking, consider putting leftover grease or oil into a container or bowl to reserve. You can then reheat and use for other cooking or quickly place in the garbage after it's hardened.</p>

TLC can utilize a camera to see down into the drain line and find the clog or break in the line. All TLC's Drain Cleaning Professionals are equipped with this kind of camera to repair the drain and recognize issue. If you have a long sewer line from your house to the sewer system or septic system, this type of camera is especially beneficial in locating an issue.</p>
