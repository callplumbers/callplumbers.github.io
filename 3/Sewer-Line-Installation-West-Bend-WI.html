The retaining nut inside the tank is a reverse thread. So, if you remain in front of the toilet, turn the nut to the left to loosen up (Photo 1). Then get rid of the old handle and lever, slide the brand-new deal with into place, and thread on the retaining nut. Tighten up by turning to the right (Picture 2).</p>
