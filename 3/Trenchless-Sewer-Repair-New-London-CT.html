<h3>Sewer And Drain Lines Video Inspection in New London Connecticut</h2>
<p>Water softening utilizes a process called "ion exchange" to remove dissolved difficult water minerals such as calcium, manganese, magnesium and iron. These minerals can't be caught by a filter, so a molecular response is needed. Water softeners have resin beads that hold onto salt, and as the hard water flows through the resin, the salt is switched for the hard water minerals. The difficult water minerals are trapped in the softener and a trace amount of salt flows out with the softened water.</p>
<p>Whether a supply of water is identified "soft" or "difficult" is dependent on the existence of two extremely soluble minerals, calcium and magnesium. From a health standpoint, these minerals have no negative effects and are, in fact, important day-to-day nutrients. It is minerals that provide water the revitalizing taste lots of people find preferable. However, when calcium and magnesium permeate water, they accumulation on contact surfaces, possibly plug pipes and damage water heaters, and decrease the efficiency of cleaning agents and soaps. At this moment the water is stated to be hard.</p>
<p>Your home's drainage works by the basic force of gravity. When you flush water and waste down your sink or shower (and your toilets as well) it's not really the flow of water pushing them down your pipes. Rather, once they decrease your drain, gravity takes over as the pipes under the ground are pitched at a down angle to the sewer line. Anything you put down there won't go through when something obstructs the pipes.</p>
