Water pressure might be or fail decreased when a water main bursts, pipes freeze, or there is suddenly high demand on the water system (for instance, when several fire hydrants are opened). Lowered pressure in the pipe may enable contaminated water from the soil, from storage, or from other sources to be drawn up into the system.</p>

<p>In some cases, an untrained individual will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the assumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair may be as simple as replacing a few rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or might require the replacement of a few of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester carries out a field test, he produces information on the functions of the assembly.  It ends up being the tester's responsibility to know what the field test information implies for that specific assembly.  When a qualified tester analyzes the data, he can identify what parts of the backflow prevention assembly stopped working the test and needs repair.</p>
