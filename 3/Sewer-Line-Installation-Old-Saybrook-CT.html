<p>A partial reroute is basically a little scale repiping of one or more afflicted areas of the plumbing underneath the slab. In cases where jackhammering and fixing the pipe are not cost effective, it is possible to only desert the affected area of pipe and reroute the line through the attics, walls and ceilings. Costing less than a complete repipe, the end outcome is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that may leak again in the future. We have actually experienced homes having 2 or more slab leakages within a 1-2 year duration, and these repairs can build up in cost extremely rapidly. This is the main reason that we will suggest a full repipe in certain communities, based upon our experience.</p>
