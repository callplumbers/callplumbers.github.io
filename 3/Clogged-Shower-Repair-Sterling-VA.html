The guide is the part that steadies the movement or directs of the element. The guide is a really important part of the design of each component. If the element is not repaired effectively, the guide could limit the motion (instead of steady or direct) of the element, which might trigger the component to not work to its abilities. Often times springs are erroneously blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. Most of the times the guides are limiting the travel of the element causing lower test outcomes than what is needed.</p>

When the control valve registers the softening capability of the resin is diminishing, the heavy salt water service is drawn out of the tank and flushed through the resin in the mineral tank.
