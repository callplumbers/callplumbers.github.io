<p>A. Usually wax does not "go bad" on a basic floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to avoid leaks. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet exists to avoid odors. If you are experiencing a leak originating from underneath the floor-mounted toilet, you most likely have a partial (or full blown) toilet stoppage down the drain line (or the toilet is split in the bowl). Likewise, make certain the leak isn't coming from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "common" undiscovered problem. Try putting a few drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a few hours if you aren't sure where the leak is coming from.</p>
<p>Although it might be appealing to pour in over the counter drain-clearing items, many plumbers recommend versus it. Not only are the chemicals hazardous if exposed to human skin, they may also damage drain pipes if overused. There are additional problems that might come up, which is why our skilled plumbers will carry out a comprehensive inspection of your system to determine what has triggered it to breakdown. From there we can make an informed choice on whether your problem can be solved by a simple repair or if changing the waste disposal unit is eventually the better alternative.</p>
<p>The sink is a central function of bathrooms and kitchens and are vulnerable to getting clogged drains. When this plumbing fixture is not running correctly, having a clogged sink or a leaking sink gets in the way of your household routine and triggers a major trouble. Sometimes you might need to replace your whole sink and our specialists are all set to assist you with sink installation in addition to our sink repair services.</p>
