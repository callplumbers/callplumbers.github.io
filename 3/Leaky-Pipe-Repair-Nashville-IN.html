<p>Viking SupplyNet's comprehensive stock of backflow valves and related gadgets consists of leading products from Wilkins, Ames, Watts, and others. Oxidants such as chlorine in the public water system respond with the polybutylene piping and acetal fittings, causing them to scale, flake, and end up being fragile. This leads to micro-fractures and lowers the basic structural stability of the system. The system ends up being weak and may fail without warning, triggering damage to the building structure and personal property. Incorrect installation is also a common reason for polybutylene system failure, which can be nearly impossible to discover.</p>
<p>While the old drain flange might appear to be in good shape, it is best to replace it with a brand-new fitting at the time of the installation.
