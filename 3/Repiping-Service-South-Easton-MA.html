<h3>Laundry Room Plumbing in South Easton Massachusetts</h2>
<p>Water softening uses a process called "ion exchange" to eliminate dissolved hard water minerals such as calcium, iron, manganese and magnesium. These minerals can't be trapped by a filter, so a molecular reaction is required. Water softeners have resin beads that keep sodium, and as the hard water streams through the resin, the salt is switched for the difficult water minerals. The tough water minerals are trapped in a trace and the softener amount of salt flows out with the softened water.</p>
<p>Home water softeners, also called ion exchange units, are devices that eliminate calcium, magnesium, and other minerals from drinking water. Resin beads inside the softener trap the calcium and magnesium and exchange them for sodium or potassium. When the resin beads become filled with calcium and magnesium, a highly-concentrated salt or potassium service gets rid of the calcium and magnesium from the beads. After going through the beads, the resulting chloride service becomes a waste stream that decreases the drain and ultimately into the environment.</p>
