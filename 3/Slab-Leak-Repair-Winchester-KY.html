<h3>Water Heater Issues and Repair at Winchester KY 40391</h3>
<p>Backflow implies the unfavorable reversal of circulation of a liquid, gas, or suspended strong into the safe and clean supply of water; a backflow preventer is designed to keep this from taking place. Points at which a safe and clean water system connects with a non-potable water supply are called cross connections. Such connections occur naturally in devices such as clothing washers and dishwashers, but they should be carefully designed and installed to prevent backflow. Another typical place for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water pipe, to avoid pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the general public water supply.</p>
