It is necessary that the repair service technician knows the appropriate installation orientation and can examine the installation conditions to ensure there are no conditions preventing the working of the assembly.

A lot of backflow preventers are installed in a horizontal orientation to the surrounding grade. Some (not all) backflow preventers can be installed in a vertical orientation, however it is essential that the assembly just be installed if it is authorized for that orientation. To arbitrarily take an RP and stand it on its end in a vertical orientation may trigger the backflow prevention assembly to not work properly and no matter how many parts you put inside the assembly, it still might not work because the installation orientation is causing the failure.</p>
