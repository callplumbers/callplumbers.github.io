<p>If you believe your toilet has a leak, the good news is that it does not necessarily require a repair of your entire unit. A toilet's tank is made up of several little moving parts, such as flapper valves and fill valves, that need to be changed or fixed due to their regular usage. When these parts wear, they lead to tiny leaks that are tough to see with the naked eye. This is why it is very important to call a plumber as soon as you presume you have a leak or a broken tank part. Not only does a leaking toilet waste water, it can also lead to flooding and water damage.</p>
