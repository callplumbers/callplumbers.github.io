Some house owners will attempt to dislodge the clog utilizing store-bought drain cleaners and natural natural home remedy, like vinegar or lemon juice with baking soda. These treatments do work, especially if you are handling a small drain clog. However, they are normally short-term repairs that do not offer permanent resolutions.</p>
