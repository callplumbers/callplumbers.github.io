<p>The discharge tube included in the disposer set will be attached to the disposer utilizing the plate, gasket and screws initially planned for the disposer discharge elbow. If your package just consists of a waste arm, it is possible - though not advised - to connect this to the disposer discharge elbow using a slip joint. The consecutive 90 ° turns in such a setup can result in inappropriate drainage. Depending on the length of the waste arm, you might have the ability to cut off its elbow and utilize the remainder as a straight discharge tube.</p>

Incorrectly seated and sealed toilets could leak, damage plumbing, or perhaps jeopardize the structural integrity of the house.</p>
