<h3>Hour Emergency Plumbing Service Milan MI</h3>
<p>These guys were fantastic! They showed up early and remained late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has been a problem on and off for years now. It was set up 7 years ago, and it never ever drained this well. I chose this company due to the fact that they had fantastic reviews and a fair rate, and despite the fact that the task took a lot more time and work than they anticipated it to, they honored their quote. I will utilize Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing requires in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were monsters. They had a big, disgusting mess on their hands (literally), and they did a fantastic task tidying up after it too.</p>
