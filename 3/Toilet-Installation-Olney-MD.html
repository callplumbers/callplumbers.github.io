<p>Echologics has a long history of establishing acclaimed acoustic technologies for leak detection on buried water pipelines. Running a camera through the household sewer pipes (typically from your home to its connection to the public sewer system) can be used to examine the type and condition of underground pipes, and to recognize problems like leaking or broken joints, intruding roots, clogs, deterioration or collapsed pipes. Homeowners may have a video inspection done to discover the reason for routine sewer backups or other ongoing problems, or when offering or buying an older house.</p>
<p>You might be lured to weld or patch a leak shut or replace just a single area of pipe to save cash. While this might work in the short term, bear in mind that the weakened pipe is made from the very same product as other pipes in your house, implying that trouble might be brewing somewhere else in your plumbing system. Repiping now will provide you assurance and prevent larger leaks down the roadway.</p>
