<p>Pipeline leak detection is used to figure out if and in some cases where a leak has taken place in systems which consist of gases and liquids. Applications vary from softening in remote locations to addressing concerns of reagent addition. Motor sizes for waste disposal unit are given up horse power, or HP. These correspond straight to just how much waste the unit can handle, and recommended sizes are normally based on the number of users remain in a household.
