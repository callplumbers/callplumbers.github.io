<h3>Main Sewer Line Replacement in Sunnyvale California</h2>
<p>A partial reroute is generally a little scale repiping of several afflicted areas of the plumbing below the slab. In cases where fixing the pipe and jackhammering are not cost efficient, it is possible to only desert the afflicted area of pipe and reroute the line through the walls, attics and ceilings. Costing less than a complete repipe, the end outcome is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that may leak again in the future. We have experienced houses having 2 or more slab leaks within a 1-2 year duration, and these repairs can build up in cost very quickly. This is the main reason why we will recommend a complete repipe in particular communities, based upon our experience.</p>
