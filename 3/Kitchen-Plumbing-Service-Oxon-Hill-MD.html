The water is continuously warmed as long as the tap stays on. If the tap is right away turned off, the water stops being heated. The heating temperature level is normally pre-set to match your choices and requirements. Since they only heat water when required, tankless electric water heaters use less power than standard water heaters.</p>
<p>Light Blue = Decreased Pressure Zone - supply pressure pushes open the # 1 check and is decreased by the # 1 Check spring (for instance, to 90 psi). This pressure distinction across the # 1 check valve preserves the relief valve in the closed position. If pressure in the Zone rises toward the supply pressure (within 2 to 3 psi), the Relief Valve discharges, preventing backflow (reverse motion of fluid).</p>
