<h3>Main Line Leak Repair in Bethpage New York</h2>
<p>In 1939, after his Roto-Rooter sewer cleaning machine showed effective, Sam Blanc created and constructed a smaller design that operated on the very same principle but could clean and clear bathroom and kitchen sink drains as well as laundry drains and other household plumbing drains. Blanc likewise constructed a much bigger version of the Roto-Rooter machine called the Roto-Rooter Royal. It needed to be pulled by a truck and featured a 10 hp gasoline engine and 1000 feet of steel cable television. It was capable of cleaning big commercial and municipal sewer pipes.
