<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow triggered by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or customer's potable water system.

Pumps can produce boosts in downstream pressure; temperature level boosts in boilers, etc. Reductions in safe and clean supply of water pressure take place whenever the amount of water being utilized exceeds the amount of water being supplied, such as during water line flushing, fire fighting, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
