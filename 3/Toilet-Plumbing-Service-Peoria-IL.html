<p>Strong sewage smell in your bathroom and other locations of your house. A sewage smell originating from your bathroom or another area of your home can be an indicator of a severe issue with your plumbing. Pipes in your home may have burst or otherwise broken. It is necessary that you contact a qualified plumber if there is a consistent sewage odor in your home. Raw sewage is very harmful and can posture severe health risks.</p>

<p>The source or place of a sewer problem determines who pays for repair. The City is responsible for the public right of way (curb to curb), from one side of the street to another.

<p>Drawbacks to be familiar with is that hybrid water heaters need to be set up in an area that remains between 40 to 90 degrees, or they will not work well. They need approximately 7 feet of clearance from the floor to ceiling, since the heat pump is on top of the water heater. Likewise, hybrids need approximately 1,000 cubic feet of uncooled space to catch sufficient heat from the air, and a drain in close distance to discharge the condensate.</p>
