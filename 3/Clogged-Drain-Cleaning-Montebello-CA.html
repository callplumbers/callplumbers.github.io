It can take a DIYer a lot of time to locate and total basic repairs, so consider that with the cost when attempting to deal with the problem on your own. The reason a toilet will not flush could be a low water level in the tank or a clogged inlet. A clog in the trap or drain beneath the toilet can also be the cause. Working with a licensed Montgomery County plumber is your initial step; a plumber can identify the problem and repair it.</p>
