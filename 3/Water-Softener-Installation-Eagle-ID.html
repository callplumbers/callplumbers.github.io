Trenchless pipe repair is a kind of pipe repair that does not involve any excavation. Trenchless pipe repair likewise called trenchless pipe lining is a exceptional and long lasting  choice for your damaged pipes. The pipe lining process involves our team saturating a felt liner with a special resin mix. When the felt liner is completely saturated, it is pressed through your pipeline. As the liner moves through your pipes, it coats the interior walls, sealing all fractures and imperfections. If heat is used, the liner is left to harden in location for a number of hours or 60 minutes. When the process is complete, the liner will be removed and your pipe will be examined one more time to ensure your new pipe is set within your existing one.</p>
