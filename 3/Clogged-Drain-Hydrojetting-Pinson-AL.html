<p>Aside from these 2 important components, there are a myriad of small, perhaps less critical things that can weaken or break. For instance, if you lose your toilet bowl bolt covers (those little caps on the base of the toilet), the bolts holding your toilet to the floor will wear away much more quickly. Consistent gross smells coming from the toilet can indicate you need a brand-new wax ring where your toilet connects to the floor drain. You may need a new cap for the fill valve if the float rod of your fill valve isn't lifting appropriately. Bulges in the supply line can cause a leak and burst. If mishandled, tank covers can split and leave your toilet's inner functions exposed. While this won't affect the function of your toilet, it definitely does not do much for the aesthetic of your bathroom. We're not trying to psych you out by pointing out all the important things that can go wrong, the point is - your toilet is a complete fixture and every part requires to be in great shape for it to work at its best.</p>

We will help you prevent the mistakes of inaccurate sink installation, guaranteeing that your new sink fits in the area you have, all pipes are functional, caulking is tight, and the sink looks and works great.</p>
