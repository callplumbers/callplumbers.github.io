<p>Button Plumbing was fantastic. If I shut off the water under the sink, they replaced my kitchen faucet and included two brand-new shut off valves under the sink which had always dripped in the past. I pointed out that my bathroom sink was draining slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were very friendly and got the work done rapidly. The rate was rather reasonable. I will certainly utilize them for any future plumbing requirements. I was extremely delighted with their service.</p>
