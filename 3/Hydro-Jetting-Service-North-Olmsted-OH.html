<p>Old, worn, or harmed plumbing pipes can trigger considerable problems. Even little leaks can slowly dampen walls and floors up until they become breeding premises for mold, mildew, and other irritants. Old galvanized iron pipes may become corroded and add rust to the water system. Gurgling sound from pipes. A strange, gurgling noise coming from the toilet whenever you flush or from the bathtub drain after you took a bath is never ever a good sign. Opportunities are your sewer line is clogged, and a plunger might not suffice to resolve this problem. Call a plumber instantly.</p>
