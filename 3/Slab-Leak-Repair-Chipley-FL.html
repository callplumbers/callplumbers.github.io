<p>A partial reroute is essentially a small scale repiping of several afflicted locations of the plumbing underneath the slab. In cases where fixing the pipe and jackhammering are not cost efficient, it is possible to just desert the afflicted section of pipe and reroute the line through the ceilings, attics and walls. Costing less than a full repipe, the end result is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that may leak once again in the future.
