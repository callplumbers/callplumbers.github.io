In addition, your contractor knows the indications of quality work that you might miss, like clean solder joints, crisp 90-degree angles at joints and clean, properly sized holes in studs, floorings, and joists. Lastly, a quality contractor will not risk dealing with a shoddy plumber.

With so much riding on the plumber, contractors tend to stick with just the best.</p>
