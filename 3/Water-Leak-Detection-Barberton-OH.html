<p>The U-shaped pipe beneath bathroom and kitchen sinks is something that people expect to see however rarely stop to think about. The flywheel is jammed: If the disposal hums when you turn the switch, but it doesn't grind up food, this suggests the flywheel is stuck. Try freeing the jam by placing a hex wrench of the proper size into the hole on the bottom of the waste disposal unit. Alternately, you can prod the flywheel by sticking a broom manage (not your fingers!) into the sink.</p>
<p>The normal option is to have the malfunctioning pipes changed when you have plumbing problems with leaking or broken pipes. However, there are some cases where you will need to have all the pipes replaced, which is where whole-house repiping comes in. This is a choice to think about if you reside in an older home - such as one developed pre-1970 - or any home with galvanized steel plumbing.
