Most of toilets are standard sized - meaning a "will fit" seat suffices for safety and convenience. Some toilets, however, have uniquely shaped bowls and need a specific seat, like the Eljer Symbol. It truly isn't a good idea to use a toilet seat that is either much too huge or much to small, unless they have been specifically designed to fit normal toilets, as the toilet seat can wobble and trigger you to slide around, or will not distribute your weight equally and could eventually cause cracks in the bowl.</p>
