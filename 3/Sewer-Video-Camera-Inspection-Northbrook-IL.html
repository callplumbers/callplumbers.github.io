<p>It is approximated that the typical person spends over 3 years of their life sitting on the toilet, and many bathroom readers are at threat of becoming completely attached to the fixture. Which is why choosing a comfy, well-made toilet seat is extremely crucial. However, you need to make sure your toilet seat in fact fits your toilet. Most of toilets are basic sized - meaning a "will fit" seat suffices for security and convenience. Some toilets, however, have distinctively formed bowls and need a specific seat, like the Eljer Emblem. It truly isn't a good concept to use a toilet seat that is either much too big or much to little, unless they have actually been specifically developed to fit normal toilets, as the toilet seat can wobble and cause you to move around, or won't distribute your weight equally and could eventually cause fractures in the bowl.</p>
<p>This is incredibly important! When you have cast iron drain lines you need 3-5 gallons of water that an older toilet supplies to push the waste out of your drain system.
