Though it might require extra adapters, versatile tubing is far simpler to deal with and can utilize push-to-connect fittings, saving you time and the trouble of soldering.</p>
<p>Inspect Valves and Double Checks. There are two other types of backflow preventers offered that you may face. The first is a check valve. The 2nd is a double check".
