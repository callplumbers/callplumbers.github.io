<h2>Tips To Hire Residential Plumbing Companies in Golden Valley</h2>

<p>Kcb plumbing contractors, Inc Most of the houses in our area were constructed before 1965, which is the time when copper piping for cold and hot water ended up being basic. Older homes were set up with galvanized iron cut and thread pipe. Iron that can be found in contact with water and oxygen will wear away. This deterioration, or rust, triggers the iron to inflate and become flaky. In order to avoid the rusting of the iron, the pipes were dipped in zinc. The zinc bonds with the iron and develops a water resistant membrane to protect the iron from rusting.</p>
<p>Older houses with steel pipes are at danger of bursts and leaks. Call Plumb Perfect Plumbing and ask about our whole house repipe services today.
