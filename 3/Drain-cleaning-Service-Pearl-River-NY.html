<p>I can't say enough good things about this company. Had a sewer repair needed and had an extremely brief amount of time due to closing on a home sale. Each and every single person I came across from Marquita doing logistics for my task to every member of the work crew. Friendly, interacted well, totally responsive and truly cared to help me through this very difficult job. All of the people I encountered were role models for what a well run service company must be. Much thanks and appreciation. You're fantastic.</p>
<p>Quality sinks properly set up last for years, so we're normally called in for kitchen and bath remodels. But with spots or scratches in a kitchen sink as well as chipped or split porcelain in bathroom sinks many property owners pick a sink installation alone. Components and sinks might also develop drain problems that call for a sink repair. Bathroom sink repairs likewise consist of changing or replacing the pop-up stopper assembly.</p>
<p>In some cases, an inexperienced person will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the assumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair may be as basic as replacing a few rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or might need the replacement of a few of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester performs a field test, he creates information on the operations of the assembly.  It ends up being the tester's duty to know what the field test data means for that specific assembly.  When an experienced tester analyzes the information, he can determine what parts of the backflow prevention assembly stopped working the test and requires repair.</p>
