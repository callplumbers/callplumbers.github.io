<p>Don't put everything down your garbage disposal. It is very important to watch what you put down your garbage disposal. Foods like rice and pasta can swell when combined with water, and possibly cause a clog. Fruit and vegetable peels can also trigger jams and obstructions - consider composting or positioning these products in the garbage. In addition, grease and oil can collect and harden in your drain as well. After ending up cooking, think about putting remaining grease or oil into a jar or bowl to reserve. You can then use and reheat for other cooking or quickly place in the garbage after it's hardened.</p>
