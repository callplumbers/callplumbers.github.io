It is very tough to evaluate such claims, which are nearly never ever based upon tests that are well enough described to enable others to assess them and to verify the results. While the absence of "clinical" evidence does not in itself revoke a claim for the effectiveness of a device, it needs to make one think twice to accept it without some guarantee of performance.</p>
