<p>Homeowners typically ask if a gas hot water heater or an electrical unit is more cost-efficient. The answer depends upon your house.

Electric varieties are likewise simpler to install, and unlike gas systems, they are less likely to lose heat.</p>
<p>The very best source for this kind of plumber is a general contractor. The contractor sees the plumber's work before it's covered up; you don't get that opportunity. In addition, your contractor understands the indications of quality work that you might miss, like clean solder joints, crisp 90-degree angles at joints and clean, properly sized holes in joists, floorings, and studs. Lastly, a quality contractor will not risk dealing with an inferior plumber. A basic error-- a joint left unsoldered or a leaky PVC line-- can quickly ravage $10,000 worth of walls or hardwood floors and complicate the job with insurance claims, lost time, and claims. With so much riding on the plumber, contractors tend to stick to just the very best.</p>
