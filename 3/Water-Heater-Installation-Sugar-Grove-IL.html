I will absolutely use Clog Dawg once again. Installing a garbage disposal takes 2 to 3 hours with a typical per hour rate of $25 to $70. These costs are in addition to the cost of the disposal unit. If your plumber has a minimum callout cost that is higher than the labor cost for the work, the total you pay may be higher.</p>
