The more effective the hot water heater the greater the EF ranking. However, even if a water heater has a greater EF value, it doesn't constantly suggest it will have lower operating expense. You likewise need to consider the fuel source.</p>
<p>Rusting and rust on the outside of the water heater, inlet pipes, or parts can show a possible concern with the water heater. It can also indicate the water heater is near the end of its life if it is more than 6 or 7 years old.
