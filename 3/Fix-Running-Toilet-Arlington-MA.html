<p>Numerous house owners think their energy companies or homeowners insurance is accountable for emergency repairs to the water, sewer, plumbing, electrical, heating and cooling systems, however the truth is that in many cases you, the house owner, are accountable. Most basic property owners insurance plan and local utility companies or municipalities do not cover repairs to or replacement of the major systems in and around your home.</p>
<p>When a flush valve triggers a toilet to run, a used flapper is normally the culprit. However not constantly. First, take a look at the chain that raises the flapper. It can tangle up and prevent the flapper from closing firmly if there's too much slack in the chain. A chain with insufficient slack can cause problem too. Picture 3 demonstrates how to set the slack just right.</p>
