<p>Clearly the resin is not a limitless exchange site. When all the salt exchange sites are changed with hardness minerals, the resin is spent and will no longer soften water. At this moment, the water softener will need to be operated on an alternate cycle called regeneration. Throughout this cycle, resin is backwashed with a salt option. The brine is reverse flushed through the system taking with it the calcium and magnesium ions that had actually been adsorbed on the resin. The softener can be returned to use once backwashing is complete. Some water softeners will instantly switch to the operation cycle. Others have a manual switch. Figure 1 illustrates both cycles of the water softening process-ion exchange and regeneration.</p>
<p>Your home's drainage works by the easy force of gravity. When you flush water and lose down your sink or shower (and your toilets also) it's not really the circulation of water pressing them down your pipes. Rather, once they go down your drain, gravity takes control of as the pipes under the ground are pitched at a downward angle to the sewer line. Anything you pour down there will not go through when something blocks the pipes.</p>
