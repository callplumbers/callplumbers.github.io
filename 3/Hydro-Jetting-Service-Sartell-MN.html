<p>We use both metal and plastic pipes in our repiping procedure. Due to the fact that it is long enduring and durable, copper is the market standard. We will offer you various options based on your budget plan and choices. PEX piping is a new choice that is versatile, resistant to corrosion, and up to 75 percent more economical than copper piping.</p>
