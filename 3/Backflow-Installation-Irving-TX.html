The factors for this can range from leaks, malfunctioning or malfunctioning electrical wiring, or a broken heating element or thermostat.

However, if the hot water heater system has all of these problems occurring regularly, then a water heater replacement is necessary.</p>

Demand-control designs, with either electrical and mechanical sensors, typically regrow after so many gallons of water have been softened. If you have a changing water use schedule, such designs are convenient.</p>
