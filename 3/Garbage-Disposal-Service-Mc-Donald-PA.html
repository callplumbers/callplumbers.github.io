<p>If you presume your toilet has a leak, the good news is that it does not necessarily need a repair of your entire unit. A toilet's tank is made up of numerous small moving parts, such as flapper valves and fill valves, that need to be replaced or fixed due to their regular use. When these parts wear out, they lead to small leaks that are hard to see with the naked eye. This is why it is important to call a plumber as quickly as you believe you have a leak or a broken tank part. Not only does a leaking toilet waste water, it can also cause flooding and water damage.</p>

Recurring use may indicate you experience problems.</p>
<p>For plumbing work other that repair or replacement components, a building license is generally needed before a plumbing permit can be provided. Soften just what you need to.
