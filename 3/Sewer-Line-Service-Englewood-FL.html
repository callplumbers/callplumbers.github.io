<p>Tankless Water Heaters - offer hot water as needed without a tank. The activation of a faucet needing hot water activates the heater and water is warmed as it flows through a heating coil or heat exchanger. Cooking oil and other greases ought to never be put down the waste disposal unit because they can hinder the blades.
