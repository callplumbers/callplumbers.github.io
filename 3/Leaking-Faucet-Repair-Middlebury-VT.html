Because these systems do not work by exchanging ions, like traditional water softeners do, one benefit declared for the user is the removal of the need to include salt to the system. While particle size decrease and plant development promo have been claimed, such systems do not eliminate minerals from the water itself. Rather, they can only change the downstream results that the mineral-bearing water would otherwise have. Testing of particular systems has revealed a decrease of calcium scale formation. 11 These systems do not fall within the term "water softening" but rather "water conditioning".</p>
