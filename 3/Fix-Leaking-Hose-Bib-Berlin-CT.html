<p>Replacing the old disposal with an identical brand-new one is less complicated than replacing with a different design. So, if you are not looking particularly for a various disposal this might be something to think about. An entirely different disposal, or for installing your very first disposal, the sink connector has to be puttied into location. A secure seal is a must. As soon as connected at the sink drain, the dishwasher port is attached. The last thing is to wire up the brand-new disposal, taking care to connect wires accurately, and the base covered to safeguard the electrical wiring from any water getting in.</p>
