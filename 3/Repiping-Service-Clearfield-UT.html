<h3>Clogged Drains Driving You Crazy Never Call The Emergency Plumber Again Clearfield UT</h3>
<p>Contrary to what lots of think, having a waste disposal unit in fact protects your pipes and extends their lifespan. Food cleaned down a drain accidentally or on function without a disposal can get stuck in pipe turns, triggering clogs and slowly destructive your plumbing system. Tiny food particles produced by a waste disposal unit wash straight down easily.</p>
<p>Hydro jetting is a process in which the sewer pipes are scrubbed clean by streams of high-pressure water shooting from a hose at as much as 3,500 PSI. This allows the sewer lines to be cleaned rapidly and effectively with high-velocity water pressure. The streams of high-pressure water, emitting from the reverse and forward jets in the nozzle, move the hose through the line to get rid of debris such as difficult water scale, sand, silt, and grease deposits.</p>
