<p>When the components are positioned back into the body, the backflow prevention assembly is prepared to be pressurized. It is very important to turn the inlet shut-off valve on gradually while the disadvantage shut off remains in the closed position. This enables the parts to move to their pressurized positions in a precise motion. When the assembly is pressurized, then any built up air must be gotten rid of from the body.
