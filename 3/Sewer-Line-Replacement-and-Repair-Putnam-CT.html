Examining the water meter is a fantastic next action in your plumbing inspection. Close all faucets and examine if the water meter is turning. There is a leak somewhere and this might be severe problem if it is. Move on to the valves. Start with the main turned off valve operation. When shut off, no faucet in your house should have water.
