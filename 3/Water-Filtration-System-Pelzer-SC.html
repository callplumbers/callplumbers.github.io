<p>Whether replacing an old one or putting one in for the very first time, there are a few things worth learning about garbage disposal installation. You depend on your water heater every day for all the hot water you and your family need to cook, clean, and shower. When your water heater quits working correctly or if it's time for an upgrade, depend on Essig Plumbing & Heating.

<p>When you have plumbing problems with leaking or broken pipes, the typical solution is to have the malfunctioning pipes changed. However, there are some cases where you will need to have all the pipes replaced, which is where whole-house repiping can be found in.

Steel was the most popular choice for home plumbing for many decades, however steel ultimately experiences corrosion and does not have the toughness of today's copper, PEX, and CPVC piping.</p>
