<p>Gently raise the rod and listen if your flapper valve has a ball that drifts at the end of a rod. You might be able to stop the running by changing the float if the water shuts off. Some fill toilet valves have a float modification screw on top (see Figure A below). Bend the float arm if there is no adjustment screw.
