<p>In some families, using a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog might be the go-to method when looking for a feasible solution, especially when simple plunging doesn't seem to work. However, there are many downsides to utilizing these harmful products - not least of which is that they normally contain compounds such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by dissolving whatever is causing a clog, which can range from the normal suspects like hair or food to mineral buildup, small things, dirt, and even roots in cases where cracked pipes on your home draw the attention of plant life. The strength of these chemicals makes them efficient, but at the cost of providing the risk of damage to your house and family.</p>
