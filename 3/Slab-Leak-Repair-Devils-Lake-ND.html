<p>All piping under sinks and faucets are looked for leakages or damage. How to tell if you have polybutylene pipes: If your pipes are white plastic and include the letters PB" in the printed label, you have polybutylene pipes and we suggest having them replaced immediately. Before you can request an inspection, you need to initially get the required license( s) for the work you mean to do.

Cracked or broken drains are generally preceded by recurring clogs, consistent nasty drain smells or the existence of sewer flies.

Have a drain connection or other issue that calls for a kitchen or bathroom sink repair? Our plumbing services are prepared for both commercial and residential needs-- laundry rooms, kitchens, and bathrooms in addition to a public lavatory, prep, wash, and janitorial sinks.</p>
<p>Your waste disposal unit makes sure that your sink and plumbing components do not get clogged. Contrary to some individuals's perception, waste disposal unit do not contain blades. Rather, a garbage disposal includes 2 stationary bolts that are repaired to a spinning disk. When the disposal is switched on the disks rapidly spin, and these bolts require food and debris to grind against a fixed mill along the periphery of the spinning disk. This high-speed action effectively pulverizes the food waste in the disposal so that it can take a trip down the drain without obstructing.</p>
