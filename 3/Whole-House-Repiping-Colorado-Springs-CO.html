<p>Depending on your scenario, your plumber might use one or a mix of piping material during your home repiping job. Copper is basic because it's long-lasting, can endure fires, and resists weather. However, copper is difficult to install, which indicates higher labor expenses. PEX or polyethylene pipes have the advantage of versatility, which means plumbers can bend the pipes getting rid of the need for joints, which saves money and time and minimizes the risk of joint leaks. PEX also resists rust and freezing better than metal pipes. Your residential plumbing company will decide which product is best depending upon your needs.</p>

<p>Deluge systems are developed so that all the sprinkler heads are open and the piping is not pressurized. These systems generally are installed in areas where the possibility of an extreme fire condition is likely, such as airplane hangars. Water to the system is held back by the deluge valve, which is connected to a fire detection system. If a fire takes place, the detection system sends a signal that opens the deluge valve, which then enables water to discharge from all of the sprinklers on the system.</p>
