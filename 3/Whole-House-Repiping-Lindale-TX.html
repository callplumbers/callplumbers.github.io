The factors for this can vary from leaks, malfunctioning or faulty electrical wiring, or a broken heating element or thermostat. If it is among the discussed problems, a repair or replacement of the parts might be enough. Nevertheless, if the hot water heater system has all of these problems taking place regularly, then a hot water heater replacement is required.</p>
