<p>If you have an older house, there's a likelihood you have galvanized pipes. And if your home was built in the 1970s or earlier, those pipes are most likely nearing completion of their life-span. As galvanized pipes age, they begin to wear away. This deterioration can lead to a buildup of lead, which can have lots of negative impacts on your health. Corroded pipes also lead to poor water quality and low water pressure.</p>
