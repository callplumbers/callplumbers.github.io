<p>This is a bad sign. Toilets should definitely never wobble, move, or wiggle. It's not you, and it's not something you're doing. That toilet should be replaced if you can move a toilet around by doing anything less intense than swinging a sledgehammer at it. Incorrectly seated and sealed toilets might leak, damage plumbing, and even compromise the structural integrity of the home.</p>

<p>Another typical argument versus the need for backflow preventers is that if all the valves are closed the water can't reverse through them, so the valves ought to prevent backflow.  The obvious problem with this is that if the backflow occurs at a time when the valve is open, like when the sprinklers are on, the valve will not stop backflow!  What if the valve is closed?  A standard manually run valve ought to stop backflow when it is closed - if the valve if fully closed, has great seals, and does not leak.  Nevertheless most of the automatic valves, such as the electric solenoid valves utilized for watering systems, will not stop backflow even when off" and totally closed.</p>
<p>The need for professional repiping services can emerge from many different scenarios.
