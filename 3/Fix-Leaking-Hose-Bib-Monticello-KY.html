<p>Waste Disposal Unit Installation Sick Of False Promises? Water flows in the tank where small resin beads switch the calcium and magnesium in the water for the salt or potassium they're holding. The beads act as a sponge, adsorbing the hardness minerals from your water. This process is described as ion exchange, and soft water is the outcome. When the resin beads have maxed out their ability to hold calcium and magnesium, it's time for them to be recharged (a process called regrowth). Throughout this process, the resin beads are washed with the highly focused saltwater solution (salt water) from the tank (made from the salt you added to the tank). The salt water requires the calcium and magnesium ions to be launched from the beads and replaced with sodium or potassium ions.</p>

Since these systems do not work by exchanging ions, like traditional water softeners do, one benefit claimed for the user is the removal of the need to add salt to the system. While particle size decrease and plant growth promotion have been claimed, such systems do not eliminate minerals from the water itself. Rather, they can only change the downstream results that the mineral-bearing water would otherwise have. Testing of specific systems has revealed a reduction of calcium scale development. 11 These systems do not fall within the term "water softening" but rather "water conditioning".</p>
