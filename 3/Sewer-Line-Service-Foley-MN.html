<p>As a locally-owned company, integrity and responsibility are incredibly important to constructing a track record for excellence. Section 312.10 of the Ohio Plumbing Code covers the installation, repairs and testing of isolation backflow preventers (BFP) and Section 608 of the Ohio Plumbing Code addresses protection of the drinkable supply of water within a structure these gadgets are known as isolation" BFP. Again, the best kind of backflow prevention is an air space, such as the outlet of a faucet and where water would stream over the rim of a sink or bathtub. The Warren County Plumbing Department checks to ensure there is an air gap, if there is no chance to provide one, then we check to see that the correct BFP device is installed. These BFP's, if testable, are needed to be checked (by a certified backflow preventer tester) upon installation and at least every twelve months thereafter.</p>
<p>Do not put everything down your garbage disposal. It is essential to watch what you put down your waste disposal unit.

After completing cooking, consider pouring leftover grease or oil into a container or bowl to set aside. You can then use and reheat for other cooking or quickly location in the garbage after it's hardened.</p>
