The tough water minerals are caught in the softener and a trace amount of salt drains with the softened water.</p>
<p>Plumbers repair and install water, gas, and other piping systems in factories, services, and homes. They install plumbing components, such as toilets and bathtubs, and home appliances, such as dishwashers and hot water heater.
