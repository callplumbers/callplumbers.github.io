<p>A cross-connection is any irreversible or temporary connection between a public water system or customer's safe and clean (i.e., drinking) water supply and any source or system containing nonpotable water or other substances. An example is the piping between a public water supply or customer's potable water supply and an auxiliary water supply, cooling system or irrigation system.</p>
<p>The mineral tank is the chamber where the hard water is softened. The supply of water line feeds the tough water into the tank. The water leaks through the bed of resin beads, transferring the water-hardening calcium and magnesium ions. The water exits the tank soft and flows through your pipes and out to your household appliances. Backflow is a term used in the plumbing world to explain an unfavorable flow of water in the reverse instructions. The backflow of water carries contaminants back to the primary water system system, making the water in it unsafe to consume.</p>
