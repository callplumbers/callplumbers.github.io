<p>Burst Pipe Hydraulic Replacement - Like pipe relining, this also does not involve digging and replacing. Instead, our service technicians use a rupturing tool that forces the existing pipeline to burst" and disintegrate. A new pipeline is immediately pulled in and fills out deep space developed by the old, burst pipe in a residential or commercial  sewer. This repair approach is normally used to replace the old pipe with a similar or larger pipe.</p>
