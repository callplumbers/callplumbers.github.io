<p>Remodeling plumbers typically charge at least $45 to $65 per hour for one guy and a truck. Once again, this doesn't consist of the cost of parts.

Plumbing parts and components for a powder room with a sink and toilet run $1,000 to $1,200, though you can easily spend far more. With this approach, you understand the turnkey price entering into the job, and any surprises are the plumber's duty, not yours.</p>
