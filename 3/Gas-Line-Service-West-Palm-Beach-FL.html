<p>Organic debris, such as grease, food, or hair stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is often the cause of clogged drains. The most typical way a plumber unblocks P-traps is with a tool referred to as a plumber's snake, cable or drain auger. The tool is thoroughly inserted down your drain to clear it of buildup. You can attempt to do this yourself, but this isn't a newbie's Do It Yourself project. If you use the tool improperly, you can damage your pipes and cause other leakages - so it's worth it to call somebody who knows the drill.</p>
