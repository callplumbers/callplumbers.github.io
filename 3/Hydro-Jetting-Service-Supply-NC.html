<p>Pipes can last anywhere from 20 to 70 years depending upon the material. To keep your home, security, and health convenience, we utilize only the best piping: polyethylene.

<p>Backpressure backflow is caused by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or customer's potable water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the drinkable supply of water pressure) can result from an increase in downstream pressure, a reduction in the drinkable water system pressure, or a mix of both. Increases in downstream pressure can be created by pumps, temperature boosts in boilers, and so on. Reductions in drinkable water system pressure occur whenever the quantity of water being utilized exceeds the quantity of water being provided, such as during water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>
<p>If you think your toilet has a leak, the good news is that it doesn't always need a repair of your whole system. A toilet's tank is composed of multiple little moving parts, such as flapper valves and fill valves, that need to be replaced or repaired due to their regular use. When these parts wear, they result in small leakages that are hard to see with the naked eye. This is why it is very important to call a plumber as quickly as you suspect you have a leak or a broken tank part. Not just does a leaking toilet waste water, it can also lead to flooding and water damage.</p>
