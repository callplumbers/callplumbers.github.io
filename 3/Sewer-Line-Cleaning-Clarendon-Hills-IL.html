<p>Your kitchen sink is an important part of your home, that makes its plumbing's effective operating a need more than a need. As soon as the test results show the repair is total, it is time to re-pressurize the plumbing system that was separated during the repair process. It is important that the plumbing system be turned on extremely slowly to assure no damage is done to the piping system. As soon as the system is pressurized, air needs to be removed from the plumbing system.
