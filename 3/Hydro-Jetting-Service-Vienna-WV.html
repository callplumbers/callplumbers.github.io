The study included tests that got rid of challenging soils, in addition to examining recording and spotting. Researchers discovered that softened water uses nearly 30% less cleaning agent, but cleans up along with water at 10 gpg hardness level. When comparing soft water with water at a 25 gpg level, that detergent savings increases to nearly 70%.</p>
