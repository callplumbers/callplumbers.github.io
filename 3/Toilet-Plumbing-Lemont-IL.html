<p>The pipe-bursting technique is utilized on pipes that are badly damaged, for replacing an entire pipe system, or for fixing larger areas of sewer pipeline The installers need physical access to the pipe in order to begin repair, which includes two four foot square gain access to pits at either end of the pipeline. The installers start by placing a "bursting head" at the gain access to point on one end of the pipe. Hydraulic power is utilized to drag the head through the pipe. As it makes its way through the system, breaking the old pipe apart and attracting a brand-new smooth pipe behind it. The pipe is a plastic product that will be resistant to root invasion for approximately 100 years.</p>
