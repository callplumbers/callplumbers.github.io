It has two spring checks, but likewise has a third check valve that is actually a vent available to atmosphere on the bottom of the valve (kept closed by the water pressure). The factor it is used in high-risk scenarios is due to the fact that if the first check valve ever breakdowns, the bottom of the valve then drains and opens. This relief valve provides an additional layer of protection compared to the DC, which will permit backflow if both check valves breakdown. This is the factor that when you evaluate an RPZ, you force water to backflow to make certain the RPZ discharges.</p>
