<p>Drain blockages in bathroom sinks can take place with time from the buildup of hair, little bits of soap and fibers from towels that accumulates within pipes. As a clog ends up being larger in time, it blocks the pipe, stopping water from draining pipes correctly.

<p>Typically triggered by slow seepage from the tank into the bowl. Put a few drops of food coloring in the tank. Wait an hour, then see and examine if you see coloring in the bowl.
