<p>Backflow indicates the unwanted reversal of flow of a liquid, gas, or suspended strong into the drinkable water system; a backflow preventer is developed to keep this from occurring. Points at which a drinkable water system connects with a non-potable water system are called cross connections. Such connections happen naturally in home appliances such as clothes washers and dishwashing machines, but they need to be thoroughly designed and set up to prevent backflow. Another common area for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water pipe, to prevent pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the public water system.</p>
