<p>In addition to water softening systems, Rinckey said that reverse osmosis systems (ROs) are rather popular with property owners in the area. He noted that there are particular impurities that homeowners are handling and an RO can help reduce those issues. Due to being mainly farming in Montcalm and Ionia counties, some house owners are installing ROs to rid their water source of nitrates that are a product of farming waste. Rinckey kept in mind that these systems get rid of around 94 percent of nitrates. Arsenic likewise naturally happens in some soils and that too can be fixed with the right RO system.</p>
