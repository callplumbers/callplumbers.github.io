<p>Kcb plumbing contractors, Inc Most of the homes in our area were built prior to 1965, which is the time when copper piping for hot and cold water ended up being standard. Older houses were set up with galvanized iron cut and thread pipe. Iron that comes in contact with water and oxygen will rust.
