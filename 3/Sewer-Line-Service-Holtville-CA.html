<p>After professional drain cleaning, there are a few things you can do to keep your drains clear. Prevent putting grease or oil down the drains. Use an option of baking soda and vinegar regularly to keep your drains and waste disposal unit clean. You can use an organic drain cleaner regular monthly to keep your drains clear. We suggest organic items, such as Bio-Clean, because they work much better than items including severe chemicals and will not cause damage to your drains or fixtures.</p>

<p>If your flapper valve has a ball that drifts at the end of a rod, carefully raise the rod and listen. You may be able to stop the running by adjusting the float if the water shuts off. Some fill toilet valves have a float adjustment screw on top (see Figure A below). If there is no modification screw, bend the float arm. If you have a Fluidmaster-style fill valve, make certain it's adjusted properly (Picture 8). You do not need to clear the tank to make these adjustments.</p>
<p>Your garbage disposal ensures that your sink and plumbing components don't get clogged. Contrary to some people's understanding, garbage disposals do not consist of blades. Rather, a garbage disposal includes two fixed bolts that are repaired to a spinning disk. When the disposal is switched on the disks quickly spin, and these bolts require food and debris to grind against a fixed grinder along the periphery of the spinning disk. This high-speed action efficiently crushes the food waste in the disposal so that it can take a trip down the drain without obstructing.</p>
