Sodium ions also have a positive charge, but it is weaker, so when they are flushed through the tank with the calcium and magnesium ions, they push them out of the water. After the procedure is complete, you end up with soft water that has sodium in it but no other minerals.</p>
<p>It's a great concept to arrange yearly inspections if your plumbing system is years old and if you know that you have a history of leaking or blocking. Test. Contact a third-party Backflow Tester from our Authorized Tester List to test the backflow assembly. The tester will submit the outcomes to us.
