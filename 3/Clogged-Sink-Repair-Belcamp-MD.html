<p>Many homeowners believe their utility companies or homeowners insurance coverage is responsible for emergency repairs to the water, sewer, plumbing, electrical, heating and cooling systems, but the truth is that in many cases you, the house owner, are accountable. Many basic house owners insurance policies and local utility companies or municipalities do not cover repairs to or replacement of the major systems in and around your home.</p>
<p>A. Normally wax doesn't "spoil" on a basic floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to avoid leaks. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet is there to prevent odors. If you are experiencing a leak originating from beneath the floor-mounted toilet, you probably have a partial (or full blown) toilet interruption down the drain line (or the toilet is split in the bowl). Also, ensure the leak isn't originating from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "typical" undiscovered issue. If you aren't sure where the leak is originating from, attempt putting a couple of drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a couple of hours.</p>
