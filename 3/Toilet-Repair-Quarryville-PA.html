<p>Disadvantages to be aware of is that hybrid water heaters need to be set up in an area that stays between 40 to 90 degrees, or they will not work well. They need up to 7 feet of clearance from the floor to ceiling, since the heat pump is on top of the water heater. Likewise, hybrids require as much as 1,000 cubic feet of uncooled space to record adequate heat from the air, and a drain in close distance to release the condensate.</p>
