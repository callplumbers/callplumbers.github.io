These materials gather in the drain and ultimately harden against the pipe walls, making them tough to remove. Your hot water heater is leaking: Hot water heater leaks are one of the most common indications that your system is at completion of its life expectancy, specifically if they are triggering major flooding or are coming from the tank itself.</p>
