<p>The economics of new high-efficiency water softeners. The specialist shut off the supply of water and loosened up the bolts that were holding the toilet to the floor.

<p>The brine tank help the water softening system in regeneration. It is a much shorter tank that sits surrounding to the mineral tank. The salt water tank holds a highly concentrated service of salt (or in some cases potassium) to bring back the resin beads' positive charge. Salt is by hand added to the brine tank in the form of blocks or pellets. These dissolve in the water at the bottom of the tank. When the control valve signs up the softening capability of the resin is decreasing, the heavy salt water service is drawn out of the tank and flushed through the resin in the mineral tank. If the brine tank runs out of salt, the water going through the system will no longer be softened.</p>
