<p>The discharge tube included in the disposer package will be attached to the disposer using the plate, gasket and screws originally intended for the disposer discharge elbow. If your set just consists of a waste arm, it is possible - though not suggested - to link this to the disposer discharge elbow using a slip joint. The consecutive 90 ° turns in such a setup can result in inappropriate drainage. Depending on the length of the waste arm, you may be able to cut off its elbow and utilize the rest as a straight discharge tube.</p>
