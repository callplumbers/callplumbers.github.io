<p>House owners can request a plumbing inspection at any time, but it is specifically sensible to organize inspections on a yearly basis and when acquiring a new house. Enzyme-Based Drain Cleaners: Like the sodium bicarbonate and vinegar mixture, an enzyme treatment will likewise keep pipes running efficiently. Enzymes are germs that feed upon organic matter, such as hair, mold, algae and other typical clog-causers. This all-natural option is efficient and safe.

<p>The individual who does the testing must be a certified backflow tester. Not all licensed plumbers have this accreditation, and a plumbing license is not needed to get this certification. I've checked with a few plumbers, and the estimate for backflow testing ranged from $150 - $250, however I would anticipate the rate to be significantly less from backflow testers who are not licensed plumbers.</p>
