<p>Depending upon what part of the world you're from you might have heard sink disposals described as waste disposal unit," food waste disposers," or, if you're actually correct, a sink waste disposal system." Whatever you call it, switching one out or setting up a new one is a relatively simple task.

When something obstructs the pipes, anything you pour down there won't go through.</p>
