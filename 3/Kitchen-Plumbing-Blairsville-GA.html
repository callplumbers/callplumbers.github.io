<p>Eventually, however, the beads reach maximum capability and can't attract any more mineral ions. At that point, the softener tank need to be restored, or, flushed clean. That's where the brine tank can be found in. An on-board computer system computes the amount of water that flows through the softener. Regeneration immediately starts when it reaches the preprogrammed setting. For a three-bedroom home and household of four, regeneration normally occurs every 12,000 gallons.</p>
<p>If the hot water heater is leaking from the bottom of the tank, that is an indicator the tank is failing and will need to be changed. Schedule an estimate as soon as possible and make sure absolutely nothing is near the heater that could be potentially damaged if it is in a garage and a little slow leak. Leaking water heaters can burst causing water damage and flooding of houses.</p>
