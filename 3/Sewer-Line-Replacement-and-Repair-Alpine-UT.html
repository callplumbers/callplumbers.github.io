<h3>How Much Does A Plumber Cost Per Hour Alpine UT</h3>
<p>These people were remarkable! They appeared early and remained late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has actually been a problem on and off for years now. It was installed 7 years ago, and it never ever drained this well. I selected this company since they had terrific reviews and a reasonable price, and even though the task took a lot more time and work than they expected it to, they honored their quote. I will utilize Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing needs in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were monsters. They had a big, disgusting mess on their hands (literally), and they did a great job tidying up after it also.</p>
