All replacements should be set up to Manatee County Utilities Standards and be the appropriate type of assembly based upon the conditions on your residential or commercial property (see section below "Required Backflow Prevention Assemblies") In addition, the assembly should fulfill the lead complimentary requirement of Area 1417 of the Safe Drinking Water Act (42 U.S.C. 300g-6) If you are still out of compliance after the thirty days, all water services will be ceased up until the assembly is in compliance.</p>
