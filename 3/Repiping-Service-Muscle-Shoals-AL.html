<p>Viking SupplyNet's extensive inventory of backflow valves and related gadgets includes leading items from Wilkins, Ames, Watts, and others. Oxidants such as chlorine in the general public water system respond with the polybutylene piping and acetal fittings, causing them to scale, flake, and become fragile. This results in micro-fractures and minimizes the fundamental structural integrity of the system. The system becomes weak and may fail without warning, triggering damage to the building structure and personal effects. Improper installation is also a common reason for polybutylene system failure, which can be almost impossible to detect.</p>

The kitchen sink drain might need a simple tightening up or a replacement. You will see the obvious spray if the leak is in the pressurized hose spray. For a leak in the drain pipe, you might need to fill the sink with water prior to examining the pipe underneath.</p>
