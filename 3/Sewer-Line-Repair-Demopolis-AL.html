<p>Changing the old disposal with a similar new one is less complex than replacing with a different model. So, if you are not looking specifically for a different disposal this may be something to consider. An entirely various disposal, or for installing your very first disposal, the sink port needs to be puttied into location. A protected seal is a must. Once connected at the sink drain, the dishwasher connector is connected. The last thing is to wire up the new disposal, making sure to link wires properly, and the base covered to protect the circuitry from any water getting in.</p>
<p>Sometimes, an inexperienced person will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the presumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair might be as easy as changing a few rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or may need the replacement of some of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester performs a field test, he generates information on the workings of the assembly.  It becomes the tester's responsibility to know what the field test data indicates for that particular assembly.  When a qualified tester translates the data, he can determine what parts of the backflow prevention assembly failed the test and needs repair.</p>
