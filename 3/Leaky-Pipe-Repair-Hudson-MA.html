Non-potable and potable water or liquids can be required into the potable supply system if these connections are not properly protected.</p>
<p>Chelation: Another technique is to present a chemical compound that functions as a chelating agent. Magnesium and calcium bind to this chelating agent and stay suspended in the water rather than developing on surface areas.
