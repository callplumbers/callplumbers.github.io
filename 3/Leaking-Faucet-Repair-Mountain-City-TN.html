<p>This kind of valve is used on farming locations. It is meant to keep the local supply of water clean in the existence of different farming pesticides, fertilizers, and other chemicals. Making use of these products is called chemigation. There are several elements to this valve. The check valve has a spring ran flapper, which permits circulation in only one direction. There is also a low pressure drain and an air vacuum release valve in the device. The last element is the injection port. This is where the chemicals are presented to go downstream of the check valve.</p>
<p>Any time the pressure on the residential or commercial property (downstream) side exceeds the pressure on the city side, the two redundant check valves close-- preventing any backflow. However, while DCV systems are considered safe for most fire defense systems, they do have a flaw: if both valves stop working or debris in the water line avoids them from closing totally, backflow can happen.</p>
