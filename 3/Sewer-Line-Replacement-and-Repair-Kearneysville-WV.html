<p>All piping under sinks and faucets are checked for leaks or damage. How to inform if you have polybutylene pipes: If your pipes are white plastic and include the letters PB" in the printed label, you have polybutylene pipes and we recommend having them changed right now. Before you can ask for an inspection, you should first obtain the required permit( s) for the work you plan to do. You can check out our Authorization page to learn more on obtaining an authorization. When you obtain a permit you can commence with the work. However, you must require inspection prior to you cover or hide any work.</p>
<p>When a flush valve triggers a toilet to run, a worn flapper is normally the offender. However not always. First, look at the chain that raises the flapper. If there's excessive slack in the chain, it can tangle up and prevent the flapper from closing securely. A chain with too little slack can trigger problem too. Image 3 shows how to set the slack just right.</p>
<p>Hydro jetting is among many trenchless services readily available to you, available via North Georgia Inliner. Hydro jetting is the use of hot, highly pressurized water through a secured hose and nozzle to clear any and all clogs.

Since a 2nd inspection isn't necessary, it also conserves you cash and time.</p>
<p>While pipe lining is an excellent choice for most people, there are some scenarios where repiping is the only option. Repiping is the process of changing old rusty pipes with durable and long-lasting new pipes. The brand-new pipes that are utilized are typically made of copper because of their resilience and other elements. Repiping is mostly done on old pipes that were built in the '70s and constructed out of galvanized metals.</p>
