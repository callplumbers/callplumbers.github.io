<p>When the hardware parts have actually been cleaned up and examined and the rubber parts have been changed, now reassemble the parts back into their elements. Some components might have extremely tight tolerances that need to be maintained. An important thing to determine on each element is the guide. The guide is the part that steadies the movement or directs of the component. The guide is an extremely important part of the design of each component. If the component is not fixed effectively, the guide might restrict the movement (rather than consistent or direct) of the element, which might trigger the part to not work to its capabilities. Sometimes springs are incorrectly blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. In most cases the guides are limiting the travel of the component triggering lower test results than what is required.</p>
