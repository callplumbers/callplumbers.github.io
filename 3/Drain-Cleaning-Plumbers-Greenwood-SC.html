<p>Your old discharge tube probably won't be the right length for your new disposal. If it's too long, just connect it to the disposal, mark it and cut it with a hacksaw for your waste disposal unit installation. (Loosen the other pipe connections, if required, to place the tube back into the tee.) If the old discharge tube is too short, you may have to make a time-wasting trip to the shop. To prevent this, make certain the new waste disposal unit installation package consists of a tube, or purchase one independently at the exact same time for about $3.</p>

<p>Wet pipe systems are installed in locations where the ambient temperature is preserved at or above 40 ° F. When a sprinkler is triggered by heat from a fire, water streams right away from the sprinkler head. These systems have water in the pipe at all times.

The addition of this chemical additive will need the installation of a high hazard protection assembly.</p>
