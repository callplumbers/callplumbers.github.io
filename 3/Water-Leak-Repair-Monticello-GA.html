<p>When you eliminate the cap to flush out the valve, check the washer for wear or cracks. Replacing a bad washer is low-cost and easy. However finding the ideal washer might not be. The most common washers are typically readily available in the house centers and hardware shops. Other styles can be tough to find. Eliminate it and take it to the shop to find a match if you decide to hunt for a washer. Plumbers usually replace the whole fill valve rather than hunt for a replacement washer.</p>
