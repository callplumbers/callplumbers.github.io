<p><img src="https://plumbingimages.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/plumbing.jpg" alt=""><p>
<p>The Plumbing and Gas Piping Program IVR system is now accepting inspection requests. CenterPoint Energy's Home Service Plus uses you an optional Pipe Protection Plan for only $3.95 a month. It covers interior, readily accessible, natural gas pipes ranging from the gas meter to your gas devices. Auto-reverse setting: Some garbage disposals come with this setting, which reverses the direction the blades spin to clear waste. This protects the blades so they don't break as fast.</p>
<p>Set out the new disposal and parts in preparation for installation. I've been to numerous carwashes that have a softener, and to the surprise of the owners, the water tests hard even after having actually gone through the softener. Generally, this is since the system is outdated or not working appropriately. Whatever the reason, you can be losing out on the benefits of soft water without even understanding it.</p>

<p>This is a bad sign. Toilets must definitely never ever wobble, shift, or wiggle. It's not you, and it's not something you're doing. That toilet must be changed if you can move a toilet around by doing anything less intense than swinging a sledgehammer at it. Incorrectly seated and sealed toilets might leak, damage plumbing, and even compromise the structural integrity of the house.</p>

<p>Having another problem with your toilet? If so, you're probably questioning if it's going to need more than an easy repair this time-or perhaps even a new toilet.

<p>Depending on the level of the clog, we may use a variety of various approaches, the most typical being hydro-jetting.

Disconnect waste disposal unit wires from electrical supply wires. Loosen screws on the electrical clamp connector and get rid of wires from the garbage disposal.</p>
