<p>Today's high-efficiency softeners are altering the economics of water softening in the carwash industry. Generally, the savings have been based mostly on decreasing chemical and cleaning agent costs.

<p>Nevertheless, UPC design code needs stand-alone residential systems utilizing non-potable piping materials to accomplish the exact same level of security as a commercial system. Increased security is likewise required when chemicals are contributed to a fire protection system provided by a potable water supply. Remind them to prevent hanging on any visible pipelines or playing with the outdoor gas meter if you have kids. Hanging on a pipeline might cause it to come loose or break, launching gas into the home. The outdoor gas meter should be kept clear of any particles, such as plants or snow, so it is easily accessible in an emergency.</p>
