<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow triggered by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or customer's safe and clean water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the potable water system pressure) can arise from an increase in downstream pressure, a decrease in the safe and clean water system pressure, or a combination of both. Pumps can create boosts in downstream pressure; temperature level boosts in boilers, etc. Decreases in drinkable water system pressure take place whenever the quantity of water being utilized exceeds the amount of water being supplied, such as throughout water line flushing, fire fighting, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
