<h3>Before Calling For Emergency Plumbing On Your Flooded Toilet Altoona PA</h3>
<p>These men were fantastic! They showed up early and remained late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has actually been an issue on and off for many years now. It was set up 7 years back, and it never ever drained this well. I picked this company due to the fact that they had great evaluations and a fair price, and although the task took a lot more time and work than they expected it to, they honored their quote. I will utilize Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing needs in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were monsters. They had a substantial, horrible mess on their hands (literally), and they did a terrific job cleaning up after it as well.</p>
