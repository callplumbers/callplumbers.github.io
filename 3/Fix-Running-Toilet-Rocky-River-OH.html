The pipe is typically 1/2 to 1-inch in size. Regularly, it enters the home near the water heater. Your main shut off is attached to the end of the water pipe. Make sure you examine both ends of the pipe. We have found cases where the copper pipe gets in the house and polybutylene is at the meter.</p>
<p>Since of the inherent style of a decreased pressure backflow assembly, changing supply pressure on a very low flow or static flow condition may cause annoyance dripping and possible fouling of the assembly.
