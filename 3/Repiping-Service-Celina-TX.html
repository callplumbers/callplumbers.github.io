<p>The program accomplishes its mission by providing for the adoption and promulgation of ideal rules and policies for the building of plumbing facilities where mandated. Cold showers? High energy bills? It might be time for a new hot water heater. However in order to reap the benefits of a new energy-efficient device, you'll need to have it set up properly. A water heater that is not installed correctly can lead to water damage, scalding temperature levels, or perhaps a fire.

<p>The City of Bellingham requires a backflow preventer on any cross-connection or possible cross-connection. The backflow preventer may be required on the water service line, within the building, or in both areas.

Assemblies not presently listed need to have been listed at the time of the initial installation.</p>
<p>A camera inspection takes the guesswork out of sewer and drain maintenance. Plus, it prevents the need to dig up your lawn. During a video camera inspection, a sewer and drain technician runs a video cable down sewer branch lines that lead from bathtubs, sinks, and other drains into the main sewer line. Utilizing the images recorded by the camera, we can pinpoint any sewer and drain line problems, such as obstructions, tree root intrusion, misaligned joints, cracks, and other damage.</p>
