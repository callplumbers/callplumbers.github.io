<p>If a cable has actually not yet been gone to the junction box, you can make the connections within the brand-new disposer at any time beforehand, joining the cable to the wires in package just before or just after mounting the disposer. Garbage disposals are pretty simple to keep. The most important thing to remember is that they are truly food disposals. Products that would otherwise enter the garbage should not be put in your disposal. This includes glass, plastic, metals (yes, flatware), paper, anything combustible, bleach, drain cleaners, and toys.</p>
<p>Loose flanges are normally the result of wood rot. The flange screws just won't hold in the soft, decayed subfloor. The best service depends upon the extent of the rot. Use an ear-type repair ring if the rot is only under the flange. The ears let you drive screws into firm wood further away from the flange. Before you install this type of ring, hold it approximately the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You may have to cut off a number of ears to make it deal with your toilet. If the rot extends well beyond the flange, you'll need to replace a section of the subfloor.</p>
