<p>It can take several weeks for backflow preventer installation and compliance to be finished. First, prepare for each device to be installed must be prepared by a RA or PE, and an application for approval sent to the DEP, which might take up to three weeks or more to process and approve. Declined plans need to be modified and resubmitted to the DEP approval queue, which can add another several weeks to the timeline.</p>
