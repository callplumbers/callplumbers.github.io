<p>Backflow is the unwanted reversal of circulation of water which may carry dirty water or other, hazardous compounds into the public supply of water and personal plumbing. Backflow can occur in a variety of situations that might draw water from places such as garden fountains, pool, or sprinkler system systems into City water supply lines.

That's where the brine tank can be found in. An on-board computer computes the quantity of water that flows through the softener. Regeneration automatically begins when it reaches the preprogrammed setting. For a three-bedroom house and household of four, regrowth typically takes place every 12,000 gallons.</p>
