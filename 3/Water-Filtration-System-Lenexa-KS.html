If you are utilizing copper pipes, solder on any nipples and fittings before linking the unit to the bypass valve to prevent melting the plastic. Seal all threads with plumber's tape. Plastic tubing like PEX can also be used. Though it might require extra adapters, flexible tubing is far easier to deal with and can utilize push-to-connect fittings, saving you time and the inconvenience of soldering.</p>
