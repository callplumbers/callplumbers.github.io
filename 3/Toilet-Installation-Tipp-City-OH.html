As a locally owned and run company, our clients enjoy sincere suggestions and safe, professional plumbing services performed to code. Galvanized pipes lose their zinc coating, making them unhealthy.</p>
<p>The source or location of a sewer problem determines who spends for repair. The City is responsible for the public right-of-way (curb to curb), from one side of the street to another. The property owner is responsible for the area from the curb to the back of their home line. Easements (usually 10 feet wide) where main sewers pass through personal property are an exception to this rule.</p>
<p>Gas lines inevitably need repairs-- age and usage will ultimately wear them down. Though regular, it's still demanding to a property owner, who might fear the inconvenience of employing a service professional to manage their (potentially) pricey repairs quickly and successfully. That's what Mr. Rooter Plumbing is here for. Our inspections ensure you are aware of every prospective gas line problem, and our repairs make sure your system is working perfectly once again.</p>
