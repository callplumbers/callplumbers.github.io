<p>Aside from these 2 crucial parts, there are a myriad of small, maybe less important things that can break or weaken. For example, if you lose your toilet bowl bolt covers (those little caps on the base of the toilet), the bolts holding your toilet to the floor will corrode much more rapidly. Constant gross smells originating from the toilet can suggest you need a new wax ring where your toilet connects to the floor drain. You might need a new cap for the fill valve if the float rod of your fill valve isn't lifting correctly. Bulges in the supply line can cause a leak and burst. If mishandled, tank lids can split and leave your toilet's inner operations exposed. While this will not impact the function of your toilet, it certainly does not do much for the aesthetic of your bathroom. We're not attempting to psych you out by discussing all the things that can go wrong, the point is - your toilet is a complete component and every part requires to be in good shape for it to function at its best.</p>
