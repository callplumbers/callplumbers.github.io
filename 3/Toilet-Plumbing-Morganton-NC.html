Points at which a drinkable water system gets in touch with a non-potable water supply are called cross connections. Such connections take place naturally in devices such as clothing washers and dishwashing machines, but they must be carefully designed and set up to avoid backflow. Another common location for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water pipe, to avoid pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the general public water system.</p>
