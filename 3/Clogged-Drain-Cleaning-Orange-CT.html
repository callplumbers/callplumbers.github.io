Toilets save lives. It may sound crazy, however it's true. Correct sanitation in the type of working toilets and properly maintained sewage systems helps prevent potentially deadly diseases from attacking you and your family. In the United States we are incredibly fortunate that most of us never have to fret about capturing such diseases, but it is still essential to keep our toilets clean and in great operating condition to avoid the potential for health problem to our households - in addition to saving ourselves the general hassle and high cost of toilet problems left unattended for too long.

<p>While you can fix some toilet problems yourself, many are hard or point to more intricate problems than what you see on the surface area.

For the typical home that doesn't have severe water issues, the Aquakinetic Series is designed with two tanks to provide you with soft, clean water.

<p>Template-Assisted Formation: Shortened to TAC, this technique uses resin beads as a catalytic nucleation website where solidity mineral ions are become a steady crystalline kind that will not cling to surfaces. These crystals are tiny and circulation normally through the water. Unlike with a softener that utilizes ion-exchange, this tank of resin beads does not require ongoing regrowth.</p>
