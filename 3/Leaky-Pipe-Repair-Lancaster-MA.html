<p>Backflow implies the undesirable turnaround of flow of a liquid, gas, or suspended strong into the drinkable water system; a backflow preventer is designed to keep this from occurring. Points at which a potable water system connects with a non-potable water system are called cross connections. Such connections happen naturally in home appliances such as clothes washers and dishwashers, but they need to be carefully designed and installed to prevent backflow. Another common area for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water main, to prevent pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the public water system.</p>
