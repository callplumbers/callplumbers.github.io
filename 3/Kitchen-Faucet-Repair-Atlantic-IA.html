<p>Inspect the house's warm water heater You will be aiming to see if it is huge enough to accommodate your requirements (a family of 4 should have at least a 40 gallon tank), where it lies, and the hot water heater's age.

Mineral deposits can pick the tank's bottom, leaving less room for water - which will mean that less water will be heated up and readily available for use. Likewise, deterioration of the tank's elements can cause the tank to have a brief life. Request that a new one be set up if the water heater is old or you see obvious indications of deterioration.</p>
