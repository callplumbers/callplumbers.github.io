<h3>Ensure Your Kitchen Sink Stays Unclogged With Three Easy Steps in Lake In The Hills IL 60156</h3>
<p>If you've constantly lived in an area with hard water, you might not realize how much it impacts you-- however if you've just recently moved from an area with soft water, you're most likely all too aware of the dry, irritated skin and frizzy, dull hair that can result from difficult water. Hard water disrupts the lathering of soaps and hair shampoos, triggering you to use more. Hard water also makes it more difficult to clean soap off your body, or shampoo out of your hair, which can result in dandruff and itching of your skin or scalp. If you have chronically dry skin or eczema, you'll likely find that hard water causes your skin to flake, itch, and redden often.</p>

If you are experiencing a leak coming from underneath the floor-mounted toilet, you most likely have a partial (or full blown) toilet interruption down the drain line (or the toilet is cracked in the bowl). Likewise, make sure the leak isn't originating from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "typical" unnoticed problem. If you aren't sure where the leak is originating from, attempt putting a few drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a few hours.</p>
