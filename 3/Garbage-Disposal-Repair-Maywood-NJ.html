<p>In 1939, after his Roto-Rooter sewer cleaning machine showed successful, Sam Blanc designed and constructed a smaller design that operated on the same concept but might clean and clear bathroom and kitchen sink drains as well as laundry drains and other household plumbing drains. Blanc also developed a much larger variation of the Roto-Rooter machine called the Roto-Rooter Royal. It needed to be pulled by a truck and included a 10 hp gas engine and 1000 feet of steel cable.
