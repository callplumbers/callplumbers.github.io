<p>The electrical and plumbing work associated with garbage disposal installation make the task possibly hazardous. That makes it a terrific factor to employ a professional plumber to install or replace your disposal. House owners can either buy the new disposal themselves and supply it to the professional for installation, or let the plumber purchase the disposal on their behalf and include it in the general cost.</p>
<p>Renovation plumbers normally charge at least $45 to $65 per hour for one male and a truck. Once again, this does not consist of the cost of parts. But more and more plumbers are charging "by the component," and their quotes are based on the rough-in for drain and supply lines ($ 300 to $400 in my area) and installation of the fixtures themselves (about $200). Plumbing parts and components for a powder room with a sink and toilet run $1,000 to $1,200, though you can quickly invest a lot more. With this approach, you know the turnkey price going into the task, and any surprises are the plumber's obligation, not yours.</p>
