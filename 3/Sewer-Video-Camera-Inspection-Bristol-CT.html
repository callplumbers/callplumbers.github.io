<h3>How Much Does A Plumber Cost Per Hour Bristol CT</h3>
<p>These people were fantastic! They showed up early and remained late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has actually been an issue off and on for years now. It was set up 7 years earlier, and it never ever drained this well. I chose this company since they had excellent reviews and a reasonable rate, and despite the fact that the job took a lot more time and work than they expected it to, they honored their quote. I will use Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing requires in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were monsters. They had a big, horrible mess on their hands (actually), and they did a fantastic job tidying up after it as well.</p>

<p>If you hear water running in your toilet and you presume a leaky toilet tank or toilet bowl, try this: squirt a few drops of food coloring to the toilet tank and let the toilet sit for about half an hour. After thirty minutes, inspect to see if any of the water in your toilet bowl has changed color. You most likely have a leak if it has.</p>
