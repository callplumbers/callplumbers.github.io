Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the potable water system pressure) can result from a boost in downstream pressure, a decrease in the drinkable water system pressure, or a mix of both. Pumps can create boosts in downstream pressure; temperature boosts in boilers, etc. Reductions in safe and clean water supply pressure take place whenever the quantity of water being utilized exceeds the amount of water being provided, such as throughout water line flushing, fire battling, or breaks in water pipe.</p>

<p>In addition to water softening systems, Rinckey said that reverse osmosis systems (ROs) are quite popular with property owners in the area. He kept in mind that there are specific pollutants that locals are handling and an RO can assist ease those issues. Due to being largely farming in Montcalm and Ionia counties, some house owners are installing ROs to rid their water source of nitrates that are a product of farming waste. Rinckey noted that these systems eliminate around 94 percent of nitrates. Arsenic also naturally occurs in some soils and that too can be remedied with the right RO system.</p>
<p>One common method for a home's water system to be contaminated is if the irrigation water lines, which could end up being polluted by pesticides or weed poison, backflow into the interior water lines. The problem could spread out exponentially if that contaminated water were to backflow into the community drinking supply. A backflow preventer not only safeguards drinking water in private houses, it also prevents wastewater in personal houses from flowing back out and contaminating the general public supply of water.</p>
