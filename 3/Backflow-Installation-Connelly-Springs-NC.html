<p>Waste Disposal Unit Installation Fed Up With False Assures? Water flows in the tank where tiny resin beads switch the calcium and magnesium in the water for the salt or potassium they're holding. The beads act as a sponge, adsorbing the hardness minerals from your water. This procedure is described as ion exchange, and soft water is the outcome. When the resin beads have actually maxed out their ability to hold calcium and magnesium, it's time for them to be recharged (a process called regeneration). Throughout this process, the resin beads are washed with the highly focused saltwater option (brine) from the tank (made from the salt you added to the tank). The brine requires the calcium and magnesium ions to be released from the beads and changed with salt or potassium ions.</p>
