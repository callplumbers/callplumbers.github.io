<p>After professional drain cleaning, there are a few things you can do to keep your drains clear. Avoid putting grease or oil down the drains. Utilize a service of baking soda and vinegar occasionally to keep your drains and garbage disposal clean. You can use a natural drain cleaner monthly to keep your drains clear. We suggest organic products, such as Bio-Clean, due to the fact that they work better than items consisting of harsh chemicals and will not cause damage to your drains or fixtures.</p>
<p>Backflow is the unfavorable turnaround of circulation in a drinkable water distribution system. Water that is constantly under pressure can only stream in one direction. Then how can water flow in reverse? Water will always stream towards the point of lowest pressure. If a water main were to break or if the fire department opened several fire hydrants to assist combat a fire, the pressure in the water pipe might drop. The need upstream could trigger a turnaround in circulation.</p>
