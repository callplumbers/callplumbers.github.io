<p>George from Clog Dawg was professional, efficient, and an excellent guy. He told me precisely what to anticipate (cost, time, process) in advance and provided as promised. I will certainly utilize Clog Dawg again. Setting up a waste disposal unit takes 2 to 3 hours with an average per hour rate of $25 to $70. These prices are in addition to the cost of the disposal unit. If your plumber has a minimum callout fee that is higher than the labor cost for the work, the total you pay might be greater.</p>

<p>Sometimes, an inexperienced individual will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the presumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair may be as basic as replacing a couple of rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or might need the replacement of some of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester performs a field test, he creates data on the operations of the assembly.  It becomes the tester's responsibility to know what the field test data means for that particular assembly.  When a qualified tester interprets the data, he can determine what parts of the backflow prevention assembly stopped working the test and needs repair.</p>
