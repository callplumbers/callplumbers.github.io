<p>Changing your sink is a step-by-step process. Step, cut, and connect the pipes. Prior to attaching any pipes to your water softener, step and cut your pipes to fit. Solder on any nipples and fittings prior to connecting the system to the bypass valve to avoid melting the plastic if you are using copper pipes. Seal all threads with plumber's tape.

Increases in downstream pressure can be created by pumps, temperature level boosts in boilers, etc. Decreases in drinkable water system pressure take place whenever the amount of water being used exceeds the quantity of water being provided, such as throughout water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
