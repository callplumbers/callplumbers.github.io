<p>Hydro jetting is among many trenchless services offered to you, accessible by means of North Georgia Inliner. Hydro jetting is the use of hot, extremely pressurized water through a protected hose and nozzle to clear any and all obstructions.

It also conserves you money and time since a 2nd inspection isn't essential.</p>
<p>We focus on repair, service and installation of all makes and designs of gas water heaters, electrical water heaters and tankless water heaters. Gently bend the float arm down to put extra pressure on the toilet valve. (To change a float that does not have an arm, see Photo 8.) Then flush the toilet to see if it works.

Give the professionals at Wingate a call to repair your running toilet and reduce lost water.</p>
