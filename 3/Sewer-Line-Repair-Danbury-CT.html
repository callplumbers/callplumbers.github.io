<h3>When Hiring A Plumber, Always Confirm The Price And Warranty Danbury CT</h3>
<p>Another typical argument against the need for backflow preventers is that if all the valves are closed the water can't reverse through them, so the valves must prevent backflow.  The apparent problem with this is that if the backflow happens at a time when the valve is open, like when the sprinklers are on, the valve will not stop backflow!  What if the valve is closed?  A basic by hand run valve needs to stop backflow when it is closed - if the valve if totally closed, has great seals, and does not leak.  Nevertheless most of the automatic valves, such as the electrical solenoid valves utilized for watering systems, will not stop backflow even when off" and completely closed.</p>
