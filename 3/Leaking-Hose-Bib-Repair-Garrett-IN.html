If there is a break in the line, the camera not only verifies the place of the break however enables you to see the nature of the break, also.

<p>Backpressure backflow is triggered by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or consumer's drinkable water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the potable water system pressure) can result from a boost in downstream pressure, a reduction in the drinkable supply of water pressure, or a combination of both. Boosts in downstream pressure can be created by pumps, temperature increases in boilers, and so on. Reductions in drinkable water system pressure occur whenever the amount of water being used goes beyond the quantity of water being provided, such as throughout water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>
