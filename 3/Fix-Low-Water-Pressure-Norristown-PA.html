Difficult water hinders the lathering of soaps and shampoos, causing you to use more. Hard water also makes it more difficult to clean soap off your body, or shampoo out of your hair, which can lead to dandruff and irritation of your skin or scalp. If you have chronically dry skin or eczema, you'll likely discover that tough water causes your skin to flake, itch, and redden typically.</p>
