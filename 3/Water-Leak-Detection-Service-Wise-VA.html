<p>It can take a number of weeks for backflow preventer installation and compliance to be finished. First, prepare for each device to be installed must be drawn up by a RA or PE, and an application for approval sent to the DEP, which might take up to three weeks or more to approve and process.

<p>When a flush valve triggers a toilet to run, a worn flapper is generally the culprit. However not always. Initially, take a look at the chain that raises the flapper. If there's excessive slack in the chain, it can tangle up and prevent the flapper from closing firmly. A chain with insufficient slack can trigger problem too. Picture 3 shows how to set the slack ideal.</p>
<p>The Delaware Department of Public Health Plumbing Permit and Inspection Program has offices in Kent and Sussex Counties. For instance, a water-main break or the opening of a fire hydrant can trigger water pipes to lose pressure. When that occurs, water is no longer pressed forward into the property, enabling it to stream backward into city water supplies.</p>
