<p>The person who does the testing should be a certified backflow tester. Not all licensed plumbers have this certification, and a plumbing license is not required to get this certification. I have actually talked to a few plumbers, and the estimate for backflow testing ranged from $150 - $250, but I would expect the cost to be significantly less from backflow testers who are not licensed plumbers.</p>
