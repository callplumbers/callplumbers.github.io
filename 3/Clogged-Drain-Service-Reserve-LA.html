Such connections occur naturally in appliances such as clothing washers and dishwashing machines, but they must be carefully developed and installed to avoid backflow. Another typical area for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water main, to avoid pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the general public supply of water.</p>
