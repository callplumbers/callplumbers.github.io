Inspecting the water meter is an excellent next action in your plumbing inspection. If the water meter is turning, close all faucets and examine. There is a leak someplace and this could be serious issue if it is. Carry on to the valves. Start with the main shut off valve operation. When shut off, no faucet in your house should have water.

<p>House water softeners, likewise called ion exchange units, are home appliances that get rid of calcium, magnesium, and other minerals from drinking water. Resin beads inside the softener trap the calcium and magnesium and exchange them for sodium or potassium.

After going through the beads, the resulting chloride option becomes a waste stream that goes down the drain and ultimately into the environment.</p>
