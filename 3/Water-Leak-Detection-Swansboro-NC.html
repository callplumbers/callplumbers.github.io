<h3>The Many Services Provided By Residential Plumbers Swansboro NC</h3>
<p>Backflow preventer installation requires the services of a licensed professional engineer (PE) or licensed registered architect (RA), and licensed master plumber (LMP). A licensed professional can help you determine if your structure requires a backflow preventer or several devices, or if you get approved for an exemption. Exemptions, which are approved in extremely unusual cases where the building is considered to not posture a danger to the water supply, should be submitted with the DEP by a PE or RA on behalf of the property owner. If your building has an existing backflow preventer, but the DEP has no record of its installation, you should have a licensed professional file a record drawing of the device, along with a preliminary test report of the device for DEP review.</p>
