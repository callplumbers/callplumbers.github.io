<p>A. Generally wax does not "spoil" on a standard floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to avoid leakages. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet is there to avoid smells. If you are experiencing a leak coming from below the floor-mounted toilet, you probably have a partial (or full blown) toilet interruption down the drain line (or the toilet is split in the bowl). Also, make certain the leak isn't originating from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "common" undiscovered issue. Attempt putting a couple of drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a couple of hours if you aren't sure where the leak is coming from.</p>
<p>Handheld sprayer. Leaks can in some cases develop on the water lines for handheld sprayers that are connected to the kitchen sink. Water will drip into the cabinet underneath if the leak is far enough down the water line.

<p>If you have a waste disposal unit, you can try discarding a tray of ice cubes down the drain, and then turn on the waste disposal unit while running water. This will knock off any food particles stuck in the disposal, and the salt will scrub it also. Leaking kitchen faucet, bathroom faucet, laundry faucet or tired, worn out sink? No problem is undue for our extremely trained plumbers. From a sink replacement, to a faucet repair or upgrade, our knowledgeable plumbing team does the job quickly and economically.</p>
