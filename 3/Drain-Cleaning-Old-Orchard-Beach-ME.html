<p>As soon as the hardware parts have been cleaned up and inspected and the rubber parts have actually been replaced, now reassemble the parts back into their components. Some parts might have extremely tight tolerances that have to be preserved. A crucial thing to recognize on each part is the guide. The guide is the part that steadies the motion or directs of the component. The guide is a very vital part of the design of each component. If the element is not repaired appropriately, the guide might limit the movement (instead of direct or steady) of the component, which could cause the component to not work to its abilities. Often times springs are mistakenly blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. In most cases the guides are limiting the travel of the element causing lower test results than what is needed.</p>
