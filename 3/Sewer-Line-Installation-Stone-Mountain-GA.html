This opts for every other shut off valve and their corresponding faucets. You are off to an excellent start if everything is working properly.</p>

<p>Deluge systems are created so that all the sprinkler heads are open and the piping is not pressurized. These systems normally are set up in areas where the possibility of an extreme fire condition is likely, such as airplane garages.

If a fire occurs, the detection system sends out a signal that opens the deluge valve, which then enables water to discharge from all of the sprinklers on the system.</p>
