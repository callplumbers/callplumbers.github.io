<p>Sometimes, an inexperienced person will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the assumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair might be as basic as changing a few rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or might require the replacement of some of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester performs a field test, he creates data on the functions of the assembly.  It ends up being the tester's task to know what the field test data indicates for that particular assembly.  When a qualified tester translates the information, he can identify what parts of the backflow prevention assembly stopped working the test and needs repair.</p>
