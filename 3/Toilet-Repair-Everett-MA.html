<p>Your kitchen sink is an important part of your house, that makes its plumbing's efficient working a need more than a need. When the test results reveal the repair is complete, it is time to re-pressurize the plumbing system that was isolated during the repair process. It is essential that the plumbing system be switched on really gradually to assure no damage is done to the piping system. As soon as the system is pressurized, air must be gotten rid of from the plumbing system. Each outlet on the plumbing system must be checked to ensure no valves were unintentionally exposed or did not close correctly when re-pressurized. When the plumbing system is pressurized, be sure all valves are completely open and notify the water user that the plumbing system has actually been returned to service.</p>

<p>Loose flanges are normally the result of wood rot. The flange screws merely won't keep in the soft, decayed subfloor. The very best solution depends upon the degree of the rot. If the rot is just under the flange, use an ear-type repair ring. The ears let you drive screws into firm wood further away from the flange. Before you install this kind of ring, hold it as much as the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You may have to cut off a number of ears to make it deal with your toilet. You'll have to replace an area of the subfloor if the rot extends well beyond the flange.</p>
