It was installed 7 years back, and it never drained this well. I chose this company due to the fact that they had excellent reviews and a fair price, and even though the job took a lot more time and work than they expected it to, they honored their quote. I will use Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing needs in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were monsters. They had a huge, horrible mess on their hands (actually), and they did a terrific job tidying up after it too.</p>
