<p>Whether you're handling a leaky faucet, a broken toilet or a leaking or burst water line, commercial and residential plumbing problems can truly slow you down. The pros at Perez Plumbing have the understanding, equipment and experience to quickly handle any plumbing issue you might have. With years of plumbing contractor experience, our highly trained professionals bring practical and affordable plumbing solutions to house and company owner in the area.</p>
<p>Jamming or Clogged: For the many part, a garbage disposal is just geared up to handle softer organic waste. It might trigger it to jam and not work correctly if bones or other difficult foods get stuck in the disposal. By running hot water through the disposal, you might have the ability to clear the clog yourself. However you run the risk of damaging the motor or blades.</p>
<p>Typically, the cost to replace a toilet varies between $ 122 and $228, with many homeowners spending around $ 150 to $180. This does not consist of the cost of the toilet, which averages $ 99 to $199, for a total toilet replacement cost of $ 221 to $427. A high-efficiency toilet with extra functions can cost $ 800 to $1,500 to install. The typical installation takes a plumber 2 to 4 hours at $ 65 per hour. If you're changing an existing toilet, add $ 30 to $50 to remove your old toilet.</p>
<p>Gas lines inevitably need repairs-- age and use will ultimately wear them down. Though regular, it's still stressful to a house owner, who might fear the trouble of working with a service professional to manage their (possibly) pricey repairs rapidly and successfully. That's what Mr. Rooter Plumbing is here for. Our inspections make sure you understand every potential gas line concern, and our repairs make certain your system is working completely again.</p>
