It has two spring checks, however also has a 3rd check valve that is actually a vent open up to environment on the bottom of the valve (kept closed by the water pressure). The reason it is utilized in high-risk circumstances is due to the fact that if the first check valve ever breakdowns, the bottom of the valve then opens and drains. This relief valve offers an extra layer of security compared to the DC, which will enable backflow if both check valves breakdown. This is the factor that when you test an RPZ, you force water to backflow to ensure the RPZ discharges.</p>
