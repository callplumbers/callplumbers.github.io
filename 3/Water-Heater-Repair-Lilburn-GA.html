<p>High water pressure likewise damages plumbing. The water entering the house puts excess pressure on faucet seal, water turned off valves and supply lines, and toilets. High water pressure causes leakages, running toilets and other plumbing problems that will continue to occur without correct pressure reduction.

<p>A. If you have rust spots, using phosphoric acid usually will help eliminate them. If you want to try the gentlest method perhaps try using some Coke on the rust first.  No, we aren't kidding, Coca-Cola includes a trace quantity of phosphoric acid. To attempt this, drain the toilet bowl to below where the rust marks are. Then pour on some Coke. Clean with a soft cloth and after that more Coke, over and over, and so on. Then utilize Naval Jelly which includes a lot more phosphoric acid (be sure to read the directions and safety warnings first!), if that does not do the technique. Naval Jelly is what we here at ® use to get rid of rust discolorations and it's easily offered at most hardware stores.</p>

<h3>Most Common Plumbing Emergencies Lilburn GA</h3>
<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow brought on by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or consumer's potable water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the potable supply of water pressure) can arise from a boost in downstream pressure, a decrease in the potable water supply pressure, or a mix of both. Pumps can produce boosts in downstream pressure; temperature boosts in boilers, etc. Reductions in potable water system pressure happen whenever the amount of water being used goes beyond the amount of water being supplied, such as throughout water line flushing, fire battling, or breaks in water mains.</p>
