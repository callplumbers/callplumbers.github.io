Water pressure might stop working or be reduced when a water main bursts, pipes freeze, or there is suddenly high demand on the water system (for instance, when a number of fire hydrants are opened). Decreased pressure in the pipe may enable infected water from the soil, from storage, or from other sources to be drawn up into the system.</p>
