<p>The source or location of a sewer problem determines who spends for repair. The City is accountable for the public right of way (curb to curb), from one side of the street to another. The homeowner is accountable for the area from the curb to the back of their property line. Easements (normally 10 feet wide) where main drains traverse private property are an exception to this guideline.</p>
