<p>As the water treatment market has actually grown in the U.S., the concept of water softening has often been misinterpreted as a purifying, cleaning or conditioning process. This is due mostly to exaggerated marketing and, in part, to consumer misunderstandings about water treatment.

The decision "to soften or not to soften" refers individual choice not requirement. However, water softening does have advantages, and downsides, that make this decision a considerable one.</p>
<p>To make it simple, property owners with testable backflow gadgets are supposed to have them checked by a certified tester annually.
