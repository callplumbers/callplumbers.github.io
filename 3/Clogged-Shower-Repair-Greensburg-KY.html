<p>Waste Disposal Unit Installation Tired of False Promises? Water circulates in the tank where small resin beads swap the calcium and magnesium in the water for the salt or potassium they're holding. The beads function as a sponge, adsorbing the hardness minerals from your water. This procedure is described as ion exchange, and soft water is the outcome. When the resin beads have actually maxed out their capability to hold calcium and magnesium, it's time for them to be recharged (a process called regeneration). During this procedure, the resin beads are cleaned with the highly focused saltwater service (salt water) from the tank (made from the salt you added to the tank). The brine requires the calcium and magnesium ions to be launched from the beads and replaced with sodium or potassium ions.</p>

It is extremely tough to evaluate such claims, which are nearly never ever based upon tests that are well enough described to enable others to assess them and to validate the outcomes. While the absence of "clinical" proof does not in itself invalidate a claim for the effectiveness of a device, it must make one think twice to accept it without some assurance of performance.</p>
