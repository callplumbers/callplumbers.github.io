<p>As soon as the hardware parts have actually been cleaned up and inspected and the rubber parts have actually been changed, now reassemble the parts back into their parts. Some components may have very tight tolerances that need to be preserved. An important thing to recognize on each component is the guide. The guide is the part that directs or steadies the motion of the component. The guide is an extremely important part of the design of each component. If the component is not fixed appropriately, the guide might restrict the motion (rather than constant or direct) of the part, which might trigger the element to not work to its abilities. Often times springs are erroneously blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. In most cases the guides are limiting the travel of the part causing lower test results than what is required.</p>
