<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow caused by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or customer's safe and clean water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the potable supply of water pressure) can result from an increase in downstream pressure, a reduction in the drinkable supply of water pressure, or a combination of both. Pumps can create increases in downstream pressure; temperature level increases in boilers, etc. Decreases in drinkable water supply pressure happen whenever the amount of water being used goes beyond the quantity of water being provided, such as during water line flushing, fire battling, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
