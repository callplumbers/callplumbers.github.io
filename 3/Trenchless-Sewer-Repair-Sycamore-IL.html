<p>Backflow implies the unwanted reversal of circulation of a liquid, gas, or suspended strong into the drinkable supply of water; a backflow preventer is designed to keep this from happening. Points at which a safe and clean water system connects with a non-potable water supply are called cross connections. Such connections occur naturally in appliances such as clothing washers and dishwashing machines, however they need to be thoroughly developed and set up to avoid backflow. Another common area for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water main, to avoid pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the general public water supply.</p>
