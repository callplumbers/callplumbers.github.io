<p>The salt water tank aids the water softening system in regeneration. It is a shorter tank that sits adjacent to the mineral tank. The salt water tank holds a highly concentrated solution of salt (or often potassium) to bring back the resin beads' positive charge. Salt is manually added to the brine tank in the form of pellets or blocks. These liquify in the water at the bottom of the tank. When the control valve registers the softening capability of the resin is decreasing, the heavy salt water solution is drawn out of the tank and flushed through the resin in the mineral tank. If the brine tank lacks salt, the water going through the unit will no longer be softened.</p>
