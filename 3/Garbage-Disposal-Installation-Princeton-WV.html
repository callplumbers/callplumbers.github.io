<p>A. Usually wax does not "go bad" on a basic floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to avoid leaks. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet is there to prevent smells. If you are experiencing a leak originating from underneath the floor-mounted toilet, you probably have a partial (or complete blown) toilet stoppage down the drain line (or the toilet is broken in the bowl). Likewise, ensure the leak isn't originating from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "normal" undiscovered problem. Attempt putting a few drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a couple of hours if you aren't sure where the leak is coming from.</p>
<p>A malfunctioning toilet is one household issue the majority of us would rather prevent. Nevertheless, you can not disregard a toilet concern. Leaks can trigger your water costs to increase, and some clogs and leakages can develop unsanitary conditions. If you've stumbled upon a toilet repair you can't handle, call the pros at Benjamin Franklin Plumbing ® of Orlando. We can likewise provide replacement and installation services. We guarantee all our work. Our toilet plumbing specialists serve residents in Orlando, Winter Season Garden, Altamonte Springs, Goldenrod and surrounding Florida neighborhoods.</p>
<p>Sometimes, an untrained person will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the assumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair might be as simple as changing a few rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or might need the replacement of some of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester carries out a field test, he generates data on the workings of the assembly.  It becomes the tester's duty to know what the field test information implies for that specific assembly.  When an experienced tester interprets the data, he can determine what parts of the backflow prevention assembly stopped working the test and needs repair.</p>
