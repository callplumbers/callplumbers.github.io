<p>Replacing your sink is a detailed procedure. Measure, cut, and connect the pipes. Before connecting any pipes to your water softener, step and cut your pipes to fit. Solder on any nipples and fittings prior to connecting the unit to the bypass valve to prevent melting the plastic if you are using copper pipes. Seal all threads with plumber's tape. Plastic tubing like PEX can likewise be used. Though it may require additional adapters, flexible tubing is far simpler to work with and can utilize push-to-connect fittings, conserving you time and the hassle of soldering.</p>
<p>Each component of the assembly need to be evaluated to determine what needs repair. The field test might not always show you the severity of the failure or whether repair parts beyond the standard rubber repair set are essential. There might be additional test treatments, beyond those established in the tester certification program, that can provide information showing the intensity of the failure that might assist in the diagnostic analysis of the backflow prevention assembly.</p>
