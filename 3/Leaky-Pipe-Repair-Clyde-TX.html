<p>A partial reroute is essentially a small scale repiping of several afflicted areas of the plumbing below the slab. In cases where fixing the pipe and jackhammering are not cost reliable, it is possible to only abandon the affected area of pipe and reroute the line through the ceilings, walls and attics. Costing less than a full repipe, completion result is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that might leak once again in the future. We have experienced houses having 2 or more slab leaks within a 1-2 year period, and these repairs can add up in cost extremely rapidly.
