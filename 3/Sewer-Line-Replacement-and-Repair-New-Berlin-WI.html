<p>Strange Sounds - If unusual gurgling is coming from your drain, it probably needs a thorough cleaning. When food or waste clog your drains, it makes it hard for the water to travel through. Due to the fact that of the tight space, the pipes typically make weird gurgling sounds as water efforts to travel through a clogged pipe. This causes the water to bubble, as just little pockets of air are accessible, resulting in the strange sounds emanating from your sink.</p>
<p>Colored water-- If your warm water seems rusty, this could be a sign that your hot water heater is rusting on the within and might start leaking quickly. You can look at this by filling a couple of five-gallon containers with your water. Compare If your cold water is clear and your hot water is a brownish color, you probably need a water heater replacement.</p>
