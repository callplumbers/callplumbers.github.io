<h3>Plumber Plumbing Contractor Salisbury NC</h3>
<p>Another common argument against the need for backflow preventers is that if all the valves are closed the water can't go backwards through them, so the valves must avoid backflow.  The obvious issue with this is that if the backflow takes place at a time when the valve is open, like when the sprinklers are on, the valve will not stop backflow!  What if the valve is closed?  A standard manually run valve ought to stop backflow when it is closed - if the valve if fully closed, has excellent seals, and does not leak.  Nevertheless the majority of the automatic valves, such as the electrical solenoid valves utilized for irrigation systems, will not stop backflow even when off" and fully closed.</p>
<p>Our backflow preventer choice consists of hose connection vacuum breakers, atmospheric vacuum breakers, dual check valves and vented double check valves. Each backflow preventer is checked for efficiency and performance prior to leaving our Cullman, Alabama factory.
