<p>One common method for a house's water system to be contaminated is if the watering water lines, which could end up being polluted by pesticides or weed toxin, backflow into the interior water lines. The problem might spread tremendously if that polluted water were to backflow into the neighborhood drinking supply. A backflow preventer not just secures drinking water in specific homes, it likewise avoids wastewater in private homes from receding out and polluting the general public supply of water.</p>
<p>Sometimes, an untrained individual will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the assumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair might be as simple as changing a few rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or may need the replacement of a few of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester carries out a field test, he creates data on the functions of the assembly.  It ends up being the tester's responsibility to know what the field test data suggests for that specific assembly.  When a skilled tester translates the information, he can identify what parts of the backflow prevention assembly stopped working the test and needs repair.</p>
