Considering that these systems do not work by exchanging ions, like conventional water softeners do, one advantage claimed for the user is the removal of the need to add salt to the system. While particle size decrease and plant development promotion have actually been claimed, such systems do not eliminate minerals from the water itself. Rather, they can only change the downstream impacts that the mineral-bearing water would otherwise have. Testing of certain systems has actually shown a decrease of calcium scale formation. 11 These systems do not fall within the term "water softening" however rather "water conditioning".</p>
