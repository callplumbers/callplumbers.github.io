<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow brought on by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or customer's safe and clean water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the potable water supply pressure) can arise from a boost in downstream pressure, a reduction in the potable supply of water pressure, or a combination of both. Pumps can develop increases in downstream pressure; temperature boosts in boilers, and so on. Decreases in potable supply of water pressure happen whenever the quantity of water being used surpasses the quantity of water being supplied, such as throughout water line flushing, fire combating, or breaks in water mains.</p>
