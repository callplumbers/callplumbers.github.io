<p>One common way for a home's water supply to be infected is if the irrigation water lines, which might become tainted by pesticides or weed poison, backflow into the interior water lines. If that contaminated water were to backflow into the community drinking supply, the issue might spread exponentially. A backflow preventer not only secures drinking water in individual residences, it likewise avoids wastewater in private homes from receding out and contaminating the general public water supply.</p>
